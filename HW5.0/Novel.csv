 ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
 
 Adventure I
 
 A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
 
 
 I
 
 To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard
 him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
 predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
 akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
 were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He
 was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
 the world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a
 false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
 and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent
 for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the
 trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and
 finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
 might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
 instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
 be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
 yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
 Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
 
 I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
 from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
 interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
 of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention;
 while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole
 Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among
 his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and
 ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his
 own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study
 of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers
 of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
 mysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
 From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his
 summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing
 up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
 and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
 successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
 his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of
 the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
 
 One night—it was on the 20th of March, 1888—I was returning from a
 journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
 my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered
 door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and
 with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a
 keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his
 extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I
 looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
 against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his
 head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
 knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own
 story. He was at work again. He had arisen out of his drug-created
 dreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the
 bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part
 my own.
 
 His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
 to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved
 me to an arm-chair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
 spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the
 fire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
 
 “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put
 on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”
 
 “Seven!” I answered.
 
 “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
 fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
 that you intended to go into harness.”
 
 “Then, how do you know?”
 
 “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
 yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless
 servant girl?”
 
 “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have
 been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had
 a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I
 have changed my clothes, I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary
 Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there,
 again, I fail to see how you work it out.”
 
 He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
 
 “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the
 inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the
 leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have
 been caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the
 edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you
 see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and
 that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the
 London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms
 smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his
 right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where
 he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not
 pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”
 
 I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
 process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,
 “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I
 could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your
 reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet I
 believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”
 
 “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
 down into an arm-chair. “You see, but you do not observe. The
 distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps
 which lead up from the hall to this room.”
 
 “Frequently.”
 
 “How often?”
 
 “Well, some hundreds of times.”
 
 “Then how many are there?”
 
 “How many? I don’t know.”
 
 “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just
 my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have
 both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these
 little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two
 of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw
 over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open
 upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”
 
 The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
 
 “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,”
 it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the
 very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses
 of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with
 matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
 This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your
 chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor
 wear a mask.”
 
 “This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it
 means?”
 
 “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has
 data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
 theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from
 it?”
 
 I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
 written.
 
 “The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,
 endeavoring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not
 be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and
 stiff.”
 
 “Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English
 paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”
 
 I did so, and saw a large _E_ with a small _g_, a _P_, and a large _G_
 with a small _t_ woven into the texture of the paper.
 
 “What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.
 
 “The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”
 
 “Not at all. The _G_ with the small _t_ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’
 which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like
 our ‘Co.’ _P_, of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the _Eg_. Let us
 glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume
 from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a
 German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable
 as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
 glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of
 that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud
 from his cigarette.
 
 “The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.
 
 “Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the
 peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have
 from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have
 written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It
 only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German
 who writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing
 his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our
 doubts.”
 
 As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating
 wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes
 whistled.
 
 “A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of
 the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred
 and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there
 is nothing else.”
 
 “I think that I had better go, Holmes.”
 
 “Not a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
 And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”
 
 “But your client—”
 
 “Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
 Sit down in that arm-chair, doctor, and give us your best attention.”
 
 A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the
 passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and
 authoritative tap.
 
 “Come in!” said Holmes.
 
 [Illustration: “A MAN ENTERED”]
 
 A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches
 in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich
 with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad
 taste. Heavy bands of Astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and
 fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which
 was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and
 secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming
 beryl. Boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were
 trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of
 barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He
 carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
 part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard
 mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand
 was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face
 he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging
 lip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the
 length of obstinacy.
 
 “You had my note?” he asked, with a deep harsh voice and a strongly
 marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from
 one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
 
 “Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
 Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom
 have I the honor to address?”
 
 “You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
 I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor
 and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme
 importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”
 
 I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into
 my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this
 gentleman anything which you may say to me.”
 
 The count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,
 “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of
 that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too
 much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon
 European history.”
 
 “I promise,” said Holmes.
 
 “And I.”
 
 “You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august
 person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may
 confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is
 not exactly my own.”
 
 “I was aware of it,” said Holmes, dryly.
 
 “The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has
 to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and
 seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak
 plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary
 kings of Bohemia.”
 
 “I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in
 his arm-chair and closing his eyes.
 
 Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
 lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as
 the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes
 slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
 
 “If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I
 should be better able to advise you.”
 
 The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
 uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore
 the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”
 he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”
 
 “Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before
 I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von
 Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of
 Bohemia.”
 
 “But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once
 more and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, “you can
 understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
 person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to
 an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_
 from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”
 
 “Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
 
 “The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy
 visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
 adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”
 
 “Kindly look her up in my index, doctor,” murmured Holmes, without
 opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing
 all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult
 to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish
 information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between
 that of a Hebrew Rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a
 monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
 
 “Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year
 1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of
 Warsaw—Yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite
 so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young
 person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of
 getting those letters back.”
 
 “Precisely so. But how—”
 
 “Was there a secret marriage?”
 
 “None.”
 
 “No legal papers or certificates?”
 
 “None.”
 
 “Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
 produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to
 prove their authenticity?”
 
 “There is the writing.”
 
 “Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”
 
 “My private note-paper.”
 
 “Stolen.”
 
 “My own seal.”
 
 “Imitated.”
 
 “My photograph.”
 
 “Bought.”
 
 “We were both in the photograph.”
 
 “Oh dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
 indiscretion.”
 
 “I was mad—insane.”
 
 “You have compromised yourself seriously.”
 
 “I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”
 
 “It must be recovered.”
 
 “We have tried and failed.”
 
 “Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”
 
 “She will not sell.”
 
 “Stolen, then.”
 
 “Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her
 house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has
 been waylaid. There has been no result.”
 
 “No sign of it?”
 
 “Absolutely none.”
 
 Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.
 
 “But a very serious one to me,” returned the King, reproachfully.
 
 “Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”
 
 “To ruin me.”
 
 “But how?”
 
 “I am about to be married.”
 
 “So I have heard.”
 
 “To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of
 Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is
 herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct
 would bring the matter to an end.”
 
 “And Irene Adler?”
 
 “Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that
 she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She
 has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most
 resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are
 no lengths to which she would not go—none.”
 
 “You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”
 
 “I am sure.”
 
 “And why?”
 
 “Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
 betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”
 
 “Oh, then, we have three days yet,” said Holmes, with a yawn. “That is
 very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into
 just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the
 present?”
 
 “Certainly. You will find me at the Langham, under the name of the
 Count Von Kramm.”
 
 “Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”
 
 “Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”
 
 “Then, as to money?”
 
 “You have _carte blanche_.”
 
 “Absolutely?”
 
 “I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to
 have that photograph.”
 
 “And for present expenses?”
 
 The king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid
 it on the table.
 
 “There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he
 said.
 
 Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it
 to him.
 
 “And mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.
 
 “Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”
 
 Holmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the
 photograph a cabinet?”
 
 “It was.”
 
 “Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have
 some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the
 wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be
 good enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o’clock, I should
 like to chat this little matter over with you.”
 
 
 II
 
 At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not
 yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house
 shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the
 fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he
 might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though
 it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which
 were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded,
 still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client
 gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the
 investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
 masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which
 made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
 quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
 mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very
 possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
 
 It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking
 groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and

  CHAPTER I.
 TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH
 
 
 Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons
 it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will
 assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,
 great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on
 a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as
 it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of
 the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is
 prefixed to the head of this chapter.
 
 For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and
 trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable
 doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which
 case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never
 have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of
 pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the
 most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the
 literature of any age or country.
 
 Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a
 workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance
 that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this
 particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could
 by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable
 difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of
 respiration,—a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered
 necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a
 little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and
 the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if,
 during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful
 grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of
 profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been
 killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old
 woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;
 and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and
 Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a
 few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to
 the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been
 imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could
 reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been
 possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer
 space of time than three minutes and a quarter.
 
 As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his
 lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron
 bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly
 from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,
 “Let me see the child, and die.”
 
 The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire:
 giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the
 young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed’s head, said, with
 more kindness than might have been expected of him:
 
 “Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.”
 
 “Lor bless her dear heart, no!” interposed the nurse, hastily
 depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which
 she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.
 
 “Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir,
 and had thirteen children of her own, and all on ’em dead except two,
 and them in the wurkus with me, she’ll know better than to take on in
 that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother,
 there’s a dear young lamb do.”
 
 Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother’s prospects failed
 in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched
 out her hand towards the child.
 
 The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips
 passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed
 wildly round; shuddered; fell back—and died. They chafed her breast,
 hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of
 hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.
 
 “It’s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!” said the surgeon at last.
 
 “Ah, poor dear, so it is!” said the nurse, picking up the cork of the
 green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to
 take up the child. “Poor dear!”
 
 “You needn’t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,” said
 the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. “It’s very
 likely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.” He
 put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door,
 added, “She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?”
 
 “She was brought here last night,” replied the old woman, “by the
 overseer’s order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked
 some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came
 from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.”
 
 The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. “The old
 story,” he said, shaking his head: “no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!
 Good-night!”
 
 The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once
 more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair
 before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.
 
 What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist
 was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only
 covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it
 would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him
 his proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old
 calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged
 and ticketed, and fell into his place at once—a parish child—the orphan
 of a workhouse—the humble, half-starved drudge—to be cuffed and
 buffeted through the world—despised by all, and pitied by none.
 
 Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan,
 left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he
 would have cried the louder.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER II.
 TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST’S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD
 
 
 For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic
 course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The
 hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported
 by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish
 authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether
 there was no female then domiciled in “the house” who was in a
 situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of
 which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with
 humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities
 magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be “farmed,”
 or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse
 some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders
 against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the
 inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental
 superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and
 for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.
 Sevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child;
 a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to
 overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was
 a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children;
 and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.
 So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own
 use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter
 allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the
 lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great
 experimental philosopher.
 
 Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a
 great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who
 demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw
 a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and
 rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died,
 four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable
 bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the
 female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a
 similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at
 the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest
 possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen
 in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want
 and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by
 accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was
 usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers
 it had never known in this.
 
 Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest
 upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,
 or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a
 washing—though the latter accident was very scarce, anything
 approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm—the jury
 would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the
 parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a
 remonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by the
 evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of
 whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was
 very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever
 the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board
 made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the
 day before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to
 behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!
 
 It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any
 very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist’s ninth birthday
 found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and
 decidedly small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had
 implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver’s breast. It had had plenty of
 room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and
 perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth
 birth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth
 birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party
 of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a
 sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be
 hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly
 startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo
 the wicket of the garden-gate.
 
 “Goodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?” said Mrs. Mann,
 thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.
 “(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash ’em
 directly.)—My heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you,
 sure-ly!”
 
 Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of
 responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave
 the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick
 which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle’s.
 
 “Lor, only think,” said Mrs. Mann, running out,—for the three boys had
 been removed by this time,—“only think of that! That I should have
 forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them
 dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.”
 
 Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have
 softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the
 beadle.
 
 “Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,” inquired
 Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, “to keep the parish officers a waiting
 at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with
 the porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may
 say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?”
 
 “I’m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear
 children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,” replied Mrs.
 Mann with great humility.
 
 Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his
 importance. He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He
 relaxed.
 
 “Well, well, Mrs. Mann,” he replied in a calmer tone; “it may be as you
 say; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and
 have something to say.”
 
 Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor;
 placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and
 cane on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the
 perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the
 cocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr.
 Bumble smiled.
 
 “Now don’t you be offended at what I’m a going to say,” observed Mrs.
 Mann, with captivating sweetness. “You’ve had a long walk, you know, or
 I wouldn’t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of somethink,
 Mr. Bumble?”
 
 “Not a drop. Nor a drop,” said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a
 dignified, but placid manner.
 
 “I think you will,” said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the
 refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. “Just a leetle drop,
 with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.”
 
 Mr. Bumble coughed.
 
 “Now, just a leetle drop,” said Mrs. Mann persuasively.
 
 “What is it?” inquired the beadle.
 
 “Why, it’s what I’m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put
 into the blessed infants’ Daffy, when they ain’t well, Mr. Bumble,”
 replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a
 bottle and glass. “It’s gin. I’ll not deceive you, Mr. B. It’s gin.”
 
 “Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?” inquired Bumble, following
 with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.
 
 “Ah, bless ’em, that I do, dear as it is,” replied the nurse. “I
 couldn’t see ’em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.”
 
 “No”; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; “no, you could not. You are a humane
 woman, Mrs. Mann.” (Here she set down the glass.) “I shall take a early
 opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.” (He drew it
 towards him.) “You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.” (He stirred the
 gin-and-water.) “I—I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann”;
 and he swallowed half of it.
 
 “And now about business,” said the beadle, taking out a leathern
 pocket-book. “The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine
 year old to-day.”
 
 “Bless him!” interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the
 corner of her apron.
 
 “And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was
 afterwards increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most
 superlative, and, I may say, supernat’ral exertions on the part of this
 parish,” said Bumble, “we have never been able to discover who is his
 father, or what was his mother’s settlement, name, or condition.”
 
 Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment’s
 reflection, “How comes he to have any name at all, then?”
 
 The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, “I inwented it.”
 
 “You, Mr. Bumble!”
 
 “I, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last
 was a S,—Swubble, I named him. This was a T,—Twist, I named _him_. The
 next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names
 ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it
 again, when we come to Z.”
 
 “Why, you’re quite a literary character, sir!” said Mrs. Mann.
 
 “Well, well,” said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment;
 “perhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.” He finished the
 gin-and-water, and added, “Oliver being now too old to remain here, the
 board have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out
 myself to take him there. So let me see him at once.”
 
 “I’ll fetch him directly,” said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that
 purpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of
 dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed
 off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent
 protectress.
 
 “Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,” said Mrs. Mann.
 
 Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,
 and the cocked hat on the table.
 
 “Will you go along with me, Oliver?” said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic
 voice.
 
 Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great
 readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had
 got behind the beadle’s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a
 furious countenance. He took the hint at once, for the fist had been
 too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his
 recollection.
 
 “Will she go with me?” inquired poor Oliver.
 
 “No, she can’t,” replied Mr. Bumble. “But she’ll come and see you
 sometimes.”
 
 This was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was,
 however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at
 going away. It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears
 into his eyes. Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you
 want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him
 a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece
 of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the
 workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little
 brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.
 Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never
 lighted the gloom of his infant years. And yet he burst into an agony
 of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him. Wretched as
 were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were
 the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in
 the great wide world, sank into the child’s heart for the first time.
 
 Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping
 his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every
 quarter of a mile whether they were “nearly there.” To these
 interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for
 the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had
 by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.
 
 Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
 hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of
 bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old
 woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him
 that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.
 
 Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,
 Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite
 certain whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about
 the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with
 his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively:
 and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed
 room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. At
 the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the
 rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face.
 
 “Bow to the board,” said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears
 that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table,
 fortunately bowed to that.
 
 “What’s your name, boy?” said the gentleman in the high chair.
 
 Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him
 tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him
 cry. These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating
 voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.
 Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite
 at his ease.
 
 “Boy,” said the gentleman in the high chair, “listen to me. You know
 you’re an orphan, I suppose?”
 
 “What’s that, sir?” inquired poor Oliver.
 
 “The boy _is_ a fool—I thought he was,” said the gentleman in the white
 waistcoat.
 
 “Hush!” said the gentleman who had spoken first. “You know you’ve got
 no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don’t
 you?”
 
 “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.
 
 “What are you crying for?” inquired the gentleman in the white
 waistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What _could_ the
 boy be crying for?
 
 “I hope you say your prayers every night,” said another gentleman in a
 gruff voice; “and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of
 you—like a Christian.”
 
 “Yes, sir,” stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was
 unconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a
 marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people
 who fed and took care of _him_. But he hadn’t, because nobody had
 taught him.
 
 “Well! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,”
 said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.
 
 “So you’ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o’clock,” added
 the surly one in the white waistcoat.
 
 For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process
 of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and
 was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he
 sobbed himself to sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws
 of England! They let the paupers go to sleep!
 
 Poor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy
 unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day
 arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence
 over all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it:
 
 The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and
 when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out
 at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered—the poor
 people liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the
 poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public
 breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and
 mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. “Oho!” said the
 board, looking very knowing; “we are the fellows to set this to rights;
 we’ll stop it all, in no time.” So, they established the rule, that all
 poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody,
 not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a
 quick one out of it. With this view, they contracted with the
 water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a
 corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and
 issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and
 half a roll of Sundays. They made a great many other wise and humane
 regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary
 to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in
 consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors’ Commons; and,
 instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had
 theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a
 bachelor! There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under
 these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society,
 if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were
 long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty. The relief was
 inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened
 people.
 
 For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was
 in full operation. It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of
 the increase in the undertaker’s bill, and the necessity of taking in
 the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their
 wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two’s gruel. But the number of
 workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were
 in ecstasies.
 
 The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a
 copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the
 purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at
 mealtimes. Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and
 no more—except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two
 ounces and a quarter of bread besides.
 
 The bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their
 spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this
 operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large
 as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager
 eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was
 composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers
 most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of
 gruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally excellent
 appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of
 slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and
 wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn’t
 been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small
 cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another
 basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to
 eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of
 tender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed
 him. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the
 master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to
 Oliver Twist.
 
 The evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master, in his
 cook’s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants
 ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long
 grace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared; the boys
 whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors
 nudged him. Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless
 with misery. He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin
 and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:
 
 “Please, sir, I want some more.”
 
 The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in
 stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then
 clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with
 wonder; the boys with fear.
 
 “What!” said the master at length, in a faint voice.
 
 “Please, sir,” replied Oliver, “I want some more.”
 
 The master aimed a blow at Oliver’s head with the ladle; pinioned him
 in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.
 
 The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into
 the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high
 chair, said,
 
 “Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for
 more!”
 
 There was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance.
 
 “For _more_!” said Mr. Limbkins. “Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer
 me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had
 eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?”
 
 “He did, sir,” replied Bumble.
 
 “That boy will be hung,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. “I
 know that boy will be hung.”
 
 Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman’s opinion. An animated
 discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and
 a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a
 reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the
 hands of the parish. In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were
 offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade,
 business, or calling.
 
 “I never was more convinced of anything in my life,” said the gentleman
 in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill
 next morning: “I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than
 I am that that boy will come to be hung.”
 
 As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated
 gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this
 narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint
 just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination
 or no.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER III.
 RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT
 HAVE BEEN A SINECURE
 
 
 For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of
 asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and
 solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of
 the board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose,
 that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the
 prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have
 established that sage individual’s prophetic character, once and for
 ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the
 wall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of this
 feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that
 pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for
 all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the
 express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and
 pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater
 obstacle in Oliver’s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all
 day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands
 before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner,
 tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and
 drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its
 cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which
 surrounded him.
 
 Let it not be supposed by the enemies of “the system,” that, during the
 period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of
 exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious
 consolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was
 allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a
 stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching
 cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated
 applications of the cane. As for society, he was carried every other
 day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a
 public warning and example. And so far from being denied the advantages
 of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every
 evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console
 his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special
 clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they
 entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be
 guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication
 distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection
 of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory
 of the very Devil himself.
 
 It chanced one morning, while Oliver’s affairs were in this auspicious
 and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way
 down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means
 of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become
 rather pressing. Mr. Gamfield’s most sanguine estimate of his finances
 could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;
 and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately
 cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his
 eyes encountered the bill on the gate.
 
 “Wo—o!” said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.
 
 The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,
 whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when
 he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was
 laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.
 
 Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but
 more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow
 on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a
 donkey’s. Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp
 wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and
 by these means turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the
 head, just to stun him till he came back again. Having completed these
 arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.
 
 The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with
 his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound
 sentiments in the board-room. Having witnessed the little dispute
 between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that
 person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield
 was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield
 smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the
 sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was
 encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse
 was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing
 for register stoves. So, he spelt the bill through again, from
 beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility,
 accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
 
 “This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to ’prentis,” said Mr.
 Gamfield.
 
 “Ay, my man,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a
 condescending smile. “What of him?”
 
 “If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a
 good ’spectable chimbley-sweepin’ bisness,” said Mr. Gamfield, “I wants
 a ’prentis, and I am ready to take him.”
 
 “Walk in,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield
 having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,
 and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his
 absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room
 where Oliver had first seen him.
 
 “It’s a nasty trade,” said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated
 his wish.
 
 “Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,” said another
 gentleman.
 
 “That’s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley
 to make ’em come down again,” said Gamfield; “that’s all smoke, and no
 blaze; vereas smoke ain’t o’ no use at all in making a boy come down,
 for it only sinds him to sleep, and that’s wot he likes. Boys is wery
 obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen’l’men, and there’s nothink like a good hot
 blaze to make ’em come down vith a run. It’s humane too, gen’l’men,
 acause, even if they’ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet
 makes ’em struggle to hextricate theirselves.”
 
 The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this
 explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.
 Limbkins. The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a
 few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words “saving of
 expenditure,” “looked well in the accounts,” “have a printed report
 published,” were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed,
 or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.
 
 At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having
 resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:
 
 “We have considered your proposition, and we don’t approve of it.”
 
 “Not at all,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
 
 “Decidedly not,” added the other members.
 
 As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of
 having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him
 that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into
 their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their
 proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business,
 if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the
 rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the
 table.
 
 “So you won’t let me have him, gen’l’men?” said Mr. Gamfield, pausing
 near the door.
 
 “No,” replied Mr. Limbkins; “at least, as it’s a nasty business, we
 think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.”
 
 Mr. Gamfield’s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he
 returned to the table, and said,
 
 “What’ll you give, gen’l’men? Come! Don’t be too hard on a poor man.
 What’ll you give?”
 
 “I should say, three pound ten was plenty,” said Mr. Limbkins.
 
 “Ten shillings too much,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
 
 “Come!” said Gamfield; “say four pound, gen’l’men. Say four pound, and
 you’ve got rid of him for good and all. There!”
 
 “Three pound ten,” repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.
 
 “Come! I’ll split the diff’erence, gen’l’men,” urged Gamfield. “Three
 pound fifteen.”
 
 “Not a farthing more,” was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.
 
 “You’re desperate hard upon me, gen’l’men,” said Gamfield, wavering.
 
 “Pooh! pooh! nonsense!” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
 “He’d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly
 fellow! He’s just the boy for you. He wants the stick, now and then:
 it’ll do him good; and his board needn’t come very expensive, for he
 hasn’t been overfed since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,
 observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.
 The bargain was made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver
 Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for
 signature and approval, that very afternoon.
 
 In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive
 astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself
 into a clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic
 performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin
 of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of
 bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:
 thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill
 him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten
 him up in that way.
 
 “Don’t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,”
 said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. “You’re a going to
 be made a ’prentice of, Oliver.”
 
 “A prentice, sir!” said the child, trembling.
 
 “Yes, Oliver,” said Mr. Bumble. “The kind and blessed gentleman which
 is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are
 a going to “prentice” you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of
 you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!—three pound
 ten, Oliver!—seventy shillins—one hundred and forty sixpences!—and all
 for a naughty orphan which nobody can’t love.”
 
 As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in
 an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child’s face, and he
 sobbed bitterly.
 
 “Come,” said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying
 to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;
 “Come, Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don’t
 cry into your gruel; that’s a very foolish action, Oliver.” It
 certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.
 
 On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all
 he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the
 gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like
 it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey:
 the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in
 either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When
 they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself,
 and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch
 him.
 
 There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. At
 the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned
 with the cocked hat, and said aloud:
 
 “Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.” As Mr. Bumble said this,
 he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, “Mind
 what I told you, you young rascal!”
 
 Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble’s face at this somewhat
 contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his
 offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining
 room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great
 window. Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one
 of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with
 the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of
 parchment which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of
 the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face,
 on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were
 lounging about.
 
 The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the
 little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had
 been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.
 
 “This is the boy, your worship,” said Mr. Bumble.

                                CHAPTER I
 
 
 A couple of years ago, on the very verge of the illness that
 subsequently overwhelmed me, I took a small furnished house in Pineland.
 I made no inspection of the place, but signed the agreement at the
 instance of the local house-agent, who proved little less inventive than
 the majority of his _confrères_.
 
 Three months of neuritis, only kept within bounds by drugs, had made me
 comparatively indifferent to my surroundings. It was necessary for me to
 move because I had become intolerant of the friends who exclaimed at my
 ill looks, and the acquaintances who failed to notice any alteration in
 me. One sister whom I really loved, and who really loved me, exasperated
 me by constant visits and ill-concealed anxiety. Another irritated me
 little less by making light of my ailment and speaking of neuritis in an
 easy familiar manner as one might of toothache or a corn. I had no
 natural sleep, and if I were not on the borderland of insanity, I was at
 least within sight of the home park of inconsequence. Reasoned behaviour
 was no longer possible, and I knew it was necessary for me to be alone.
 
 I do not wish to recall this bad time nor the worse that ante-dated my
 departure, when I was at the mercy of venal doctors and indifferent
 nurses, dependent on grudged bad service and overpaid inattention,
 taking a so-called rest cure. But I do wish to relate a most curious
 circumstance, or set of circumstances, that made my stay in Pineland
 memorable, and left me, after my sojourn there, obsessed with the story
 of which I found the beginning on the first night of my arrival, and the
 end in the long fevered nights that followed. I myself hardly know how
 much is true and how much is fiction in this story; for what the _cache_
 of letters is responsible, and for what the morphia.
 
 The house at Pineland was called Carbies, and it was haunted for me from
 the first by Margaret Capel and Gabriel Stanton. Quite early in my stay
 I must have contemplated writing about them, knowing that there was no
 better way of ridding myself of their phantoms, than by trying to make
 them substantial in pen and ink. I had their letters and some scraps of
 an unfinished diary to help me, a notebook with many blank pages, the
 garrulous reticence of the village apothecary, and the evidence of the
 sun-washed God’s Acre by the old church.
 
 To begin at the beginning.
 
 It was a long drive from Pineland station to Carbies. I had sent my maid
 in advance, but there was no sign of her when my ricketty one-horse fly
 pulled up at the garden gate of a suburban villa of a house “standing
 high” it is true, and with “creeper climbing about its white-painted
 walls.” But otherwise with no more resemblance to the exquisite and
 secluded cottage _ornée_ I had in my mind, and that the house-agent had
 portrayed in his letters, than a landscape by Matise to one by Ruysdael.
 
 I was too tired then to be greatly disappointed. Two servants had been
 sent in by my instructions, and the one who opened the door to me proved
 to be a cheerful-looking young person of the gollywog type, with a
 corresponding cap, who relieved me of my hand luggage and preceded me to
 the drawing-room, where wide windows and a bright fire made me oblivious
 for the moment of the shabby furniture, worn carpet, and mildewed
 wallpaper. Tea was brought to me in a cracked pot on a veneered tray.
 The literary supplement of _The Times_ and an American magazine were all
 I had with which to occupy myself. And they proved insufficient. I began
 to look about me; and became curiously and almost immediately conscious
 that my new abode must have been inhabited by a sister or brother of the
 pen. The feeling was not psychic. The immense writing-table stood
 sideways in the bow-window as only “we” know how to place it. The
 writing-chair looked sufficiently luxurious to tempt me to an immediate
 trial; there were a footstool and a big waste-paper basket; all
 incongruous with the cheap and shabby drawing-room furniture. Had only
 my MS. paper been to hand, ink in the substantial glass pot, and my twin
 enamel pens available, I think I should then and there have abjured all
 my vows of rest and called upon inspiration to guide me to a fresh
 start.
 
 “_Work whilst ye have the light_” had been my text for months; driving
 me on continually. It seemed possible, even then, that the time before
 me was short. I left the fire and my unfinished tea. Instinctively I
 found the words rising to my lips, “I could write here.” That was the
 way a place always struck me. Whether I could or could not write there?
 Seated in that convenient easy-chair I felt at once that my shabby new
 surroundings were sympathetic to me, that I fitted in and was at home in
 them.
 
 I had come straight from a narrow London house where my bedroom
 overlooked a mews, and my sitting-room other narrow houses with a
 roadway between. Here, early in March, from the wide low window I saw
 yellow gorse overgrowing a rough and unkempt garden. Beyond the garden
 more flaming gorse on undulating common land, then hills, and between
 them, unmistakable, the sombre darkness of the sea. Up here the air was
 very still, but the smell of the gorse was strong with the wind from
 that distant sea. I wished for pens and paper at first; then drifted
 beyond wishes, dreaming I knew not of what, but happier and more content
 than I had been for some time past. The air was healing, so were the
 solitude and silence. My silence and solitude were interrupted, my
 content came abruptly to an end.
 
 “Dr. Kennedy!”
 
 I did not rise. In those bad neuritis days rising was not easy. I stared
 at the intruder, and he at me. But I guessed in a minute to what his
 unwelcome presence was due. My anxious, dearly beloved, and fidgetty
 sister had found out the name of the most noted Æsculapius of the
 neighbourhood and had notified him of my arrival, probably had given him
 a misleading and completely erroneous account of my illness, certainly
 asked him to call. I found out afterwards I was right in all my guesses
 save one. This was not the most noted Æsculapius of the neighbourhood,
 but his more youthful partner. Dr. Lansdowne was on his holiday. Dr.
 Kennedy had read my sister’s letter and was now bent upon carrying out
 her instructions. As I said, we stared at each other in the advancing
 dusk.
 
 “You have only just come?” he ventured then.
 
 “I’ve been here about an hour,” I replied—“a quiet hour.”
 
 “I had your sister’s letter,” he said apologetically, if a little
 awkwardly, as he advanced into the room.
 
 “She wrote you, then?”
 
 “Oh yes! I’ve got the letter somewhere.” He felt in his pocket and
 failed to find it.
 
 “Won’t you sit down?”
 
 There was no chair near the writing-table save the one upon which I sat.
 A further reason why I knew my predecessor here had been a writer! Dr.
 Kennedy had to fetch one, and I took shallow stock of him meanwhile. A
 tall and not ill-looking man in the late thirties or early forties, he
 had on the worst suit of country tweeds I had ever seen and
 incongruously well-made boots. Now he sprawled silently in the selected
 chair, and I waited for his opening. Already I was nauseated with
 doctors and their methods. In town I had seen everybody’s favourite
 nostrum-dispenser, and none of them had relieved me of anything but my
 hardly earned cash. I mean to present a study of them one day, to get
 something back from what I have given. Dr. Kennedy did not accord with
 the black-coated London brigade, and his opening was certainly
 different.
 
 “How long have you been feeling unwell?” That was what I expected, this
 was the common gambit. Dr. Kennedy sat a few minutes without speaking at
 all. Then he asked me abruptly:
 
 “Did you know Mrs. Capel?”
 
 “Who?”
 
 “Margaret Capel. You knew she lived here, didn’t you? That it was here
 it all happened?”
 
 “What happened?”
 
 “Then you don’t know?” He got up from his chair in a fidgetty sort of
 way and went over to the other window. “I hoped you knew her, that she
 had been a friend of yours. I hoped so ever since I had your sister’s
 letter. Carbies! It seemed so strange to be coming here again. I can’t
 believe it is ten years ago; it is all so vivid!” He came back and sat
 down again. “I ought not to talk about her, but the whole room and house
 are so full of memories. She used to sit, just as you are sitting now,
 for hours at a time, dreaming. Sometimes she would not speak to me at
 all. I had to go away; I could see I was intruding.”
 
 The cynical words on my lips remained unuttered. He was tall, and if his
 clothes had fitted him he might have presented a better figure. I hate a
 morning coat in tweed material. The adjective “uncouth” stuck. I saw it
 was a clever head under the thick mane of black hair, and wondered at
 his tactlessness and provincial garrulity. I nevertheless found myself
 not entirely uninterested in him.
 
 “Do you mind my talking about her? Incandescent! I think that word
 describes her best. She burned from the inside, was strung on wires, and
 they were all alight. She was always sitting just where you are now, or
 upstairs at the piano. She was a wonderful pianist. Have you been
 upstairs, into the room she turned into a music room?”
 
 “As I told you, I have only been here an hour. This is the only room I
 have seen.”
 
 My tone must have struck him as wanting in cordiality, or interest.
 
 “You didn’t want me to come up tonight?” He looked through his
 pocketbook for Ella’s letter, found it, and began to read, half aloud.
 How well I knew what Ella would have said to him.
 
 “She has taken ‘Carbies’; call upon her at once ... let me know what you
 think ... don’t be misled by her high spirits....” He read it half aloud
 and half to himself. He seemed to expect my sympathy. “I used to come
 here so often, two or three times a day sometimes.”
 
 “Was she ill?” The question was involuntary. Margaret Capel was nothing
 to me.
 
 “Part of the time. Most of the time.”
 
 “Did you do her any good?”
 
 Apparently he had no great sense or sensitiveness of professional
 dignity. There was a strange light in his eyes, brilliant yet fitful,
 conjured up by the question. It was the first time he seemed to
 recognize my existence as a separate entity. He looked directly at me,
 instead of gazing about him reminiscently.
 
 “I don’t know. I did my best. When she was in pain I stopped it ...
 sometimes. She did not always like the medicines I prescribed. And you?
 You are suffering from neuritis, your sister says. That may mean
 anything. Where is it?”
 
 “In my legs.”
 
 I did not mean him to attend me; I had come away to rid myself of
 doctors. And anyway I liked an older man in a professional capacity. But
 his eccentricity of manner or deportment, his want of interest in me and
 absorption in his former patient, his ill-cut clothes and unlikeness to
 his brother professionals, were a little variety, and I found myself
 answering his questions.
 
 “Have you tried Kasemol? It is a Japanese cure very efficacious; or any
 other paint?”
 
 “I am no artist.”
 
 He smiled. He had a good set of teeth, and his smile was pleasant.
 
 “You’ve got a nurse, or a maid?”
 
 “A maid. I’m not ill enough for nurses.”
 
 “Good. Did you know this was once a nursing-home? After she found that
 out she could never bear the place....”
 
 He was talking again about the former occupant of the house. My ailment
 had not held his attention long.
 
 “She said she smelt ether and heard groaning in the night. I suppose it
 seems strange to you I should talk so much about her? But Carbies
 without Margaret Capel.... You _do_ mind?”
 
 “No, I don’t. I daresay I shall be glad to hear all about her one day,
 and the story. I see you have a story to tell. Of course I remember her
 now. She wrote a play or two, and some novels that had quite a little
 vogue at one time. But I’m tired tonight.”
 
 “So short a journey ought not to tire you.” He was observing me more
 closely. “You look overdriven, too fine-drawn. We must find out all
 about it. Not tonight of course. You must not look upon this as a
 professional visit at all, but I could not resist coming. You would
 understand, if you had known her. And then to see you sitting at her
 table, and in the same attitude....” He left off abruptly. So the regard
 I had flattered myself to be personal was merely reminiscent. “You don’t
 write too, by any chance, do you? That would be an extraordinary
 coincidence.”
 
 He might as well have asked Melba if she sang. Blundering fool! I was
 better known than Margaret Capel had ever been. Not proud of my position
 because I have always known my limitations, but irritated nevertheless
 by his ignorance, and wishful now to get rid of him.
 
 “Oh, yes! I write a little sometimes. Sorry my position at the table
 annoys you. But I don’t play the piano.” He seemed a little surprised or
 hurt at my tone, as he well might, and rose to go. I rose, too, and held
 out my hand. After all I did not write under my own name, so how could
 he have known unless Ella had told him? When he shook hands with me he
 made no pretence of feeling my pulse, a trick of the trade which I
 particularly dislike. So I smiled at him. “I am a little irritable.”
 
 “Irritability is characteristic of the complaint. And I have bored you
 horribly, I fear. But it was such an excitement coming up here again.
 May I come in the morning and overhaul you? My partner, Dr. Lansdowne,
 for whom your sister’s letter was really intended, is away. Does that
 matter?”
 
 “I shouldn’t think so.”
 
 “He is a very able man,” he said seriously.
 
 “And are you not?” By this time my legs were aching badly and I wanted
 to get rid of him.
 
 “In the morning, then.”
 
 He seemed as if he would have spoken again, but thought better of it. He
 had certainly a personality, but one that I was not sure I liked. He
 took an inconceivable time winding up or starting his machine, the buzz
 of it was in my ears long after he went off, blowing an unnecessary
 whistle, making my pain unbearable.
 
 I dined in bed and treated myself to an extra dose of nepenthe on the
 excuse of the fatigue of my journey. The prescription had been given to
 me by one of those eminent London physicians of whom I hope one day to
 make a pen-and-ink drawing. It is an insidious drug with varying
 effects. That night I remember the pain was soon under weigh and the
 strange half-wakeful dreams began early. It was good to be out of pain
 even if one knew it to be only a temporary deliverance. The happiness of
 a recovered amiability soon became mine, after which conscience began to
 worry me because I had been ungrateful to my sister and had run away
 from her, and been rude to her doctor, that strange doctor. I smiled in
 my drowsiness when I thought of him and his beloved Margaret Capel, a
 strange devotee at a forgotten shrine, in his cutaway checked coat and
 the baggy trousers. But the boots might have come from Lobb. His hands
 were smooth, of the right texture. Evidently the romance of his life had
 been this Margaret Capel.
 
 So this place had been a nursing-home, and when she knew it she heard
 groans and smelt ether. Her books were like that: fanciful, frothy. She
 had never a straightforward story to tell. It was years since I had
 heard her name, and I had forgotten what little I knew, except that I
 had once been resentful of the fuss the critics had made over her. I
 believed she was dead, but could not be sure. Then I thought of Death,
 and was glad it had no terrors for me. No one could go on living as I
 had been doing, never out of pain, without seeing Death as a release.
 
 A burning point of pain struck me again, and because I was drugged I
 found it unbearable. Before it was too late and I became drowsier I
 roused myself for another dose. To pour out the medicine and put the
 glass down without spilling it was difficult, the table seemed uneven.
 Later my brain became confused, and my body comfortable.
 
 It was then I saw Margaret Capel for the first time, not knowing who she
 was, but glad of her appearance, because it heralded sleep. Always
 before the drug assumed its fullest powers, I saw kaleidoscopic changes,
 unsubstantial shapes, things and people that were not there. Wonderful
 things sometimes. This was only a young woman in a grey silk dress, of
 old-fashioned cut, with puffed sleeves and wide skirts. She had a mass
 of fair hair, _blonde cendré_, and with a blue ribbon snooded through
 it. At first her face was nebulous, afterwards it appeared with a little
 more colour in it, and she had thin and tremulous pink lips. She looked
 plaintive, and when our eyes met she seemed a little startled at seeing
 me in her bed. The last thing I saw of her was a wavering smile, rather
 wonderful and alluring. I knew at once that she was Margaret Capel. But
 she was quickly replaced by two Chinese vases and a conventional design
 in black and gold. I had been too liberal with that last dose of
 nepenthe, and the result was the deep sleep or unconsciousness I liked
 the least of its effects, a blank passing of time.
 
 The next morning, as usual after such a debauch, I was heavy and
 depressed, still drowsy but without any happiness or content. I had
 often wondered I could keep a maid, for latterly I was always either
 irritable or silent. Not mean, however. That has never been one of my
 faults, and may have been the explanation. Suzanne asked how I had slept
 and hoped I was better, perfunctorily, without waiting for an answer.
 She was a great fat heavy Frenchwoman, totally without sympathetic
 quality. I told her not to pull up the blinds nor bring coffee until I
 rang.
 
 “I am quite well, but I don’t want to be bothered. The servants must do
 the housekeeping. If Dr. Kennedy calls say I am too ill to see him.”
 
 I often wish one could have dumb servants. But Suzanne was happily
 lethargic and not argumentative. I heard afterwards that she gave my
 message verbatim to the doctor: “Madame was not well enough to see him,”
 but softened it by a suggestion that I would perhaps be better tomorrow
 and perhaps he would come again. His noisy machine and unnecessary horn
 spoiled the morning and angered me against Ella for having brought him
 over me.
 
 I felt better after lunch and got up, making a desultory exploration of
 the house and finding my last night’s impression confirmed. The position
 was lonely without being secluded. All round the house was the rough
 garden, newly made, unfinished, planted with trees not yet grown and
 kitchen stuff. Everywhere was the stiff and prickly gorse. On the front
 there were many bedrooms; some, like my own, had broad balconies whereon
 a bed could be wheeled. The place had probably at one time been used as
 an open-air cure. Then Margaret Capel must have taken it, altered this
 that and the other, but failed to make a home out of what had been
 designed for a hospital. By removing a partition two of these bedrooms
 had been turned into one. This one was large, oak-floored, and a
 Steinway grand upon a platform dominated one corner. There was a big
 music stand. I opened it and found no clearance of music had been made.
 It was full and deplorably untidy. The rest of the furniture consisted
 of tapestry-covered small and easy-chairs, a round table, a great sofa
 drawn under one of the windows, and some amateur water colours.
 
 On the ground floor the dining-room looked unused and the library smelt
 musty. It was lined with open cupboards or bookcases, the top shelves
 fitted with depressing-looking tomes and the lower one bulging with
 yellow-backed novels, old-fashioned three-volume novels, magazines dated
 ten years back, and an “olla podrida” of broken-backed missing-leaved
 works by Hawley Smart, Mrs. Lovett Cameron, and Charles Lever. Nothing
 in either of these rooms was reminiscent of Margaret Capel. I was glad
 to get back to the drawing-room, on the same floor, but
 well-proportioned and agreeable. Today, with the sun out and my fatigue
 partly gone, its shabbiness looked homely and even attractive. The
 position of the writing-table again made its appeal. Suzanne had
 unpacked my writing-things and they stood ready for arrangement, heaped
 up together on the green leather top. I saw with satisfaction that there
 were many drawers and that the table was both roomy and convenient. The
 view from the window was altered by the sunlight. The yellow gorse was
 still the most prominent feature, but beyond it today one saw the sea
 more plainly, a little dim and hazy in the distance but unmistakable;
 melting into the horizon. Today the sky was of a summer blue although it
 was barely spring. I felt my courage revive. Again I said to myself that
 I could write here, and silently rescinded my intention of resting.
 “_Work whilst ye have the light._” I had not a great light, but another
 than myself to work for, and perhaps not much time.
 
 The gollywog put a smiling face and a clean cap halfway into the room
 and said:
 
 “Please, ma’am, cook wishes to know if she can speak to you, and if you
 please there is no....”
 
 There tumbled out a list of household necessities, which vexed me
 absurdly. But the writing-chair was comfortable and helped me through
 the narrative. The table was alluring, and I wanted to be alone. Cook
 arrived before Mary had finished, and then the monologue became a duet.
 
 “There’s not more than half a dozen glasses altogether, and I’m sure I
 don’t know what to do about the teapot. There’s only one tray....”
 
 “And as for the cooking utensils, well, I never see such a lot. And that
 dirty! The kitchen dresser has never been cleaned out since the flood, I
 should think. Stuffed up with dirty cloths and broken crockery. As for
 the kitchen table, there’s knives without handles and forks without
 prongs; not a shape that isn’t dented; the big fish kettle’s got a hole
 in it as big as your ’and, and the others ain’t fit to use. The pastry
 board’s broke....”
",Twilight
3," disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to
 my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look
 three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod
 he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes
 tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his
 pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed
 heartily for some minutes.
 
 “Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked; and laughed again until
 he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
 
 “What is it?”
 
 “It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed
 my morning, or what I ended by doing.”
 
 “I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and
 perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”
 
 “Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.
 I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning, in the
 character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and
 freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all
 that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_
 villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to
 the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on
 the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,
 and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could
 open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
 could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it
 and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting
 anything else of interest.
 
 “I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there
 was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent
 the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in
 exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,
 and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say
 nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood in whom I was
 not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to
 listen to.”
 
 “And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.
 
 “Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She
 is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
 Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives
 out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom
 goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male
 visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,
 never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey
 Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a
 confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,
 and knew all about him. When I had listened to all that they had to
 tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to
 think over my plan of campaign.
 
 “This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the
 matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation
 between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she
 his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had
 probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter,
 it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I
 should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the
 gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it
 widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these
 details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are
 to understand the situation.”
 
 “I am following you closely,” I answered.
 
 “I was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab drove
 up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably
 handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached—evidently the man of whom
 I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman
 to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of
 a man who was thoroughly at home.
 
 “He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of
 him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking
 excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently
 he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up
 to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it
 earnestly. ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &
 Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the church of St. Monica in the
 Edgware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’
 
 “Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do
 well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the
 coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear,
 while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It
 hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I
 only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman,
 with a face that a man might die for.
 
 “‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if
 you reach it in twenty minutes.’
 
 “This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether
 I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau,
 when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a
 shabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of
 St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty
 minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was
 clear enough what was in the wind.
 
 “My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others
 were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses
 were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried
 into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had
 followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with
 them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I
 lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
 church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
 me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.”
 
 “Thank God!” he cried. “You’ll do. Come! Come!”
 
 “What then?” I asked.
 
 “Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.”
 
 “I was half-dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where I was, I
 found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and
 vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting
 in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,
 bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman
 thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the
 clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position
 in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of
 it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been
 some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely
 refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky
 appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the
 streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I
 mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.”
 
 “This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”
 
 “Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the
 pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt
 and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they
 separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I
 shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said, as she left
 him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I
 went off to make my own arrangements.”
 
 “Which are?”
 
 “Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I
 have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still
 this evening. By the way, doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”
 
 “I shall be delighted.”
 
 “You don’t mind breaking the law?”
 
 “Not in the least.”
 
 “Nor running a chance of arrest?”
 
 “Not in a good cause.”
 
 “Oh, the cause is excellent!”
 
 “Then I am your man.”
 
 “I was sure that I might rely on you.”
 
 “But what is it you wish?”
 
 “When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
 you. Now,” he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our
 landlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not
 much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene
 of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at
 seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”
 
 “And what then?”
 
 “You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.
 There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,
 come what may. You understand?”
 
 “I am to be neutral?”
 
 “To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
 unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed
 into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window
 will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give
 you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You
 quite follow me?”
 
 “Entirely.”
 
 “It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
 roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket,
 fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is
 confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken
 up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the
 street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made
 myself clear?”
 
 “I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at
 the signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and
 to wait you at the corner of the street.”
 
 “Precisely.”
 
 “Then you may entirely rely on me.”
 
 “That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare
 for the new role I have to play.”
 
 He disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the
 character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His
 broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic
 smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such
 as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that
 Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul
 seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a
 fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a
 specialist in crime.
 
 It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
 wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine
 Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as
 we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming
 of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from
 Sherlock Holmes’s succinct description, but the locality appeared to
 be less private that I expected. On the contrary, for a small street
 in a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a
 group of shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
 scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
 nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and
 down with cigars in their mouths.
 
 “You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the
 house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes
 a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse
 to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming
 to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find
 the photograph?”
 
 “Where, indeed?”
 
 “It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet
 size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows
 that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two
 attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that
 she does not carry it about with her.”
 
 “Where, then?”
 
 “Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am
 inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they
 like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to any one
 else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell
 what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a
 business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within
 a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be
 in her own house.”
 
 “But it has twice been burgled.”
 
 “Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”
 
 “But how will you look?”
 
 “I will not look.”
 
 “What then?”
 
 “I will get her to show me.”
 
 “But she will refuse.”
 
 “She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her
 carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”
 
 As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the
 curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to
 the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at
 the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a
 copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with
 the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by
 the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the
 scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was
 struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,
 was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
 struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes
 dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her
 he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely
 down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one
 direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better
 dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,
 crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene
 Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she
 stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of
 the hall, looking back into the street.
 
 “Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.
 
 “He is dead,” cried several voices.
 
 “No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone
 before you can get him to hospital.”
 
 “He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s
 purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a
 rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”
 
 “He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”
 
 “Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.
 This way, please!”
 
 Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the
 principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post
 by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been
 drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not
 know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part
 he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of
 myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom
 I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
 upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to
 Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.
 I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.
 After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing
 her from injuring another.
 
 Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who
 is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At
 the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed
 my rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner
 out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and
 ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek
 of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at
 the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment
 later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false
 alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
 of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm
 in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly
 and in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of
 the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgware Road.
 
 “You did it very nicely, doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been
 better. It is all right.”
 
 “You have the photograph?”
 
 “I know where it is.”
 
 “And how did you find out?”
 
 “She showed me, as I told you that she would.”
 
 “I am still in the dark.”
 
 “I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was
 perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that every one in the street was
 an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”
 
 “I guessed as much.”
 
 “Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the
 palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my
 face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”
 
 “That also I could fathom.”
 
 “Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could
 she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I
 suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined
 to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were
 compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”
 
 “How did that help you?”
 
 “It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,
 her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It
 is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken
 advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it
 was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married
 woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.
 Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house
 more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to
 secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting
 were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
 photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right
 bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as
 she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she
 replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have
 not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the
 house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;
 but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it
 seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”
 
 “And now?” I asked.
 
 “Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
 to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown
 into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that
 when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be
 a satisfaction to His Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”
 
 “And when will you call?”
 
 “At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a
 clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a
 complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without
 delay.”
 
 We had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door. He was
 searching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:
 
 “Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”
 
 There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting
 appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
 
 “I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly-lit
 street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”
 
 
 III
 
 I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast
 and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
 
 “You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either
 shoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.
 
 “Not yet.”
 
 “But you have hopes?”
 
 “I have hopes.”
 
 “Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”
 
 “We must have a cab.”
 
 “No, my brougham is waiting.”
 
 “Then that will simplify matters.” We descended, and started off once
 more for Briony Lodge.
 
 “Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.
 
 “Married! When?”
 
 “Yesterday.”
 
 “But to whom?”
 
 “To an English lawyer named Norton.”
 
 “But she could not love him?”
 
 “I am in hopes that she does.”
 
 “And why in hopes?”
 
 “Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If
 the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does
 not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with
 your Majesty’s plan.”
 
 “It is true. And yet—Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What
 a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which
 was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.
 
 The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon
 the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
 brougham.
 
 “Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.
 
 “I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a
 questioning and rather startled gaze.
 
 “Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left
 this morning with her husband by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for
 the Continent.”
 
 “What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
 surprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”
 
 “Never to return.”
 
 “And the papers?” asked the King, hoarsely. “All is lost.”
 
 “We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
 drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
 scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open
 drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
 Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter,
 and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The
 photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was
 superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My
 friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at
 midnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way:
 
   “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very
   well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of
   fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had
   betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against
   you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an
   agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been
   given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you
   wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard
   to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you
   know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume
   is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom
   which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran
   up-stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and
   came down just as you departed.
 
   “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
   really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
   Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and
   started for the Temple to see my husband.
 
   “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by
   so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty
   when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may
   rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he.
   The King may do what he will without hinderance from one whom
   he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself,
   and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any
   steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph
   which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock
   Holmes, very truly yours,      IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.”
 
 “What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we
 had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and
 resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not
 a pity that she was not on my level?”
 
 “From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very
 different level to your Majesty,” said Holmes, coldly. “I am sorry
 that I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more
 successful conclusion.”
 
 “On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more
 successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as
 safe as if it were in the fire.”
 
 “I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”
 
 “I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward
 you. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and
 held it out upon the palm of his hand.
 
 “Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”
 said Holmes.
 
 “You have but to name it.”
 
 “This photograph!”
 
 The King stared at him in amazement.
 
 “Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”
 
 “I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.
 I have the honor to wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and,
 turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched
 out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of
 Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by
 a woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but
 I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler,
 or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honorable
 title of _the_ woman.
 
 
 
 
 Adventure II
 
 THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
 
 
 I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn
 of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout,
 florid-faced, elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an apology
 for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled me
 abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
 
 “You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he
 said, cordially.
 
 “I was afraid that you were engaged.”
 
 “So I am. Very much so.”
 
 “Then I can wait in the next room.”
 
 “Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper
 in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will
 be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”
 
 The stout gentleman half-rose from his chair and gave a bob of
 greeting, with a quick, little, questioning glance from his small,
 fat-encircled eyes.
 
 “Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair and putting
 his finger-tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I
 know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and
 outside the conventions and humdrum routine of every-day life. You have
 shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to
 chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish
 so many of my own little adventures.”
 
 “Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I
 observed.
 
 “You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went
 into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that
 for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to
 life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the
 imagination.”
 
 “A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”
",Holmes
4," The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a
 moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon,
 the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.
 
 “Oh, is this the boy?” said the old gentleman.
 
 “This is him, sir,” replied Mr. Bumble. “Bow to the magistrate, my
 dear.”
 
 Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been
 wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates’ powder, whether all
 boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards
 from thenceforth on that account.
 
 “Well,” said the old gentleman, “I suppose he’s fond of
 chimney-sweeping?”
 
 “He doats on it, your worship,” replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly
 pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn’t.
 
 “And he _will_ be a sweep, will he?” inquired the old gentleman.
 
 “If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he’d run away
 simultaneous, your worship,” replied Bumble.
 
 “And this man that’s to be his master—you, sir—you’ll treat him well,
 and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?” said the old
 gentleman.
 
 “When I says I will, I means I will,” replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.
 
 “You’re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,
 open-hearted man,” said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in
 the direction of the candidate for Oliver’s premium, whose villainous
 countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the
 magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn’t reasonably
 be expected to discern what other people did.
 
 “I hope I am, sir,” said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.
 
 “I have no doubt you are, my friend,” replied the old gentleman: fixing
 his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the
 inkstand.
 
 It was the critical moment of Oliver’s fate. If the inkstand had been
 where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen
 into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been
 straightway hurried off. But, as it chanced to be immediately under his
 nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his
 desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his
 search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and
 terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks
 and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his
 future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too
 palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.
 
 The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to
 Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and
 unconcerned aspect.
 
 “My boy!” said the old gentleman, “you look pale and alarmed. What is
 the matter?”
 
 “Stand a little away from him, Beadle,” said the other magistrate:
 laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of
 interest. “Now, boy, tell us what’s the matter: don’t be afraid.”
 
 Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that
 they would order him back to the dark room—that they would starve
 him—beat him—kill him if they pleased—rather than send him away with
 that dreadful man.
 
 “Well!” said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most
 impressive solemnity. “Well! of all the artful and designing orphans
 that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.”
 
 “Hold your tongue, Beadle,” said the second old gentleman, when Mr.
 Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.
 
 “I beg your worship’s pardon,” said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having
 heard aright. “Did your worship speak to me?”
 
 “Yes. Hold your tongue.”
 
 Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold
 his tongue! A moral revolution!
 
 The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his
 companion, he nodded significantly.
 
 “We refuse to sanction these indentures,” said the old gentleman:
 tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.
 
 “I hope,” stammered Mr. Limbkins: “I hope the magistrates will not form
 the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper
 conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.”
 
 “The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the
 matter,” said the second old gentleman sharply. “Take the boy back to
 the workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.”
 
 That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively
 and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he
 would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his
 head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good;
 whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him;
 which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem
 to be a wish of a totally opposite description.
 
 The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was
 again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would
 take possession of him.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER IV.
 OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC
 LIFE
 
 
 In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained,
 either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the
 young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to
 sea. The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took
 counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in
 some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port. This
 suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done
 with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to
 death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his
 brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty
 generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman
 of that class. The more the case presented itself to the board, in this
 point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared;
 so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for
 Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.
 
 Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries,
 with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a
 cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to
 communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate,
 no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.
 
 Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit
 of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour,
 and shoes to answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a
 smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional
 jocosity. His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward
 pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by
 the hand.
 
 “I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.
 Bumble,” said the undertaker.
 
 “You’ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,” said the beadle, as he
 thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the
 undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. “I
 say you’ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,” repeated Mr. Bumble,
 tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his
 cane.
 
 “Think so?” said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half
 disputed the probability of the event. “The prices allowed by the board
 are very small, Mr. Bumble.”
 
 “So are the coffins,” replied the beadle: with precisely as near an
 approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.
 
 Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be;
 and laughed a long time without cessation. “Well, well, Mr. Bumble,” he
 said at length, “there’s no denying that, since the new system of
 feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more
 shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble.
 Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron
 handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.”
 
 “Well, well,” said Mr. Bumble, “every trade has its drawbacks. A fair
 profit is, of course, allowable.”
 
 “Of course, of course,” replied the undertaker; “and if I don’t get a
 profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the
 long-run, you see—he! he! he!”
 
 “Just so,” said Mr. Bumble.
 
 “Though I must say,” continued the undertaker, resuming the current of
 observations which the beadle had interrupted: “though I must say, Mr.
 Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage:
 which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who
 have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first
 to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble,
 that three or four inches over one’s calculation makes a great hole in
 one’s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.”
 
 As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an
 ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a
 reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it
 advisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his
 mind, he made him his theme.
 
 “By the bye,” said Mr. Bumble, “you don’t know anybody who wants a boy,
 do you? A porochial ’prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a
 millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr.
 Sowerberry, liberal terms?” As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to
 the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words “five
 pounds”: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size.
 
 “Gadso!” said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged
 lappel of his official coat; “that’s just the very thing I wanted to
 speak to you about. You know—dear me, what a very elegant button this
 is, Mr. Bumble! I never noticed it before.”
 
 “Yes, I think it rather pretty,” said the beadle, glancing proudly
 downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. “The
 die is the same as the porochial seal—the Good Samaritan healing the
 sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear’s
 morning, Mr. Sowerberry. I put it on, I remember, for the first time,
 to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway
 at midnight.”
 
 “I recollect,” said the undertaker. “The jury brought it in, ‘Died from
 exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,’
 didn’t they?”
 
 Mr. Bumble nodded.
 
 “And they made it a special verdict, I think,” said the undertaker, “by
 adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had—”
 
 “Tush! Foolery!” interposed the beadle. “If the board attended to all
 the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they’d have enough to do.”
 
 “Very true,” said the undertaker; “they would indeed.”
 
 “Juries,” said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont
 when working into a passion: “juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling
 wretches.”
 
 “So they are,” said the undertaker.
 
 “They haven’t no more philosophy nor political economy about ’em than
 that,” said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.
 
 “No more they have,” acquiesced the undertaker.
 
 “I despise ’em,” said the beadle, growing very red in the face.
 
 “So do I,” rejoined the undertaker.
 
 “And I only wish we’d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for
 a week or two,” said the beadle; “the rules and regulations of the
 board would soon bring their spirit down for ’em.”
 
 “Let ’em alone for that,” replied the undertaker. So saying, he smiled,
 approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.
 
 Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the
 inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his
 rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the
 undertaker, said in a calmer voice:
 
 “Well; what about the boy?”
 
 “Oh!” replied the undertaker; “why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good
 deal towards the poor’s rates.”
 
 “Hem!” said Mr. Bumble. “Well?”
 
 “Well,” replied the undertaker, “I was thinking that if I pay so much
 towards ’em, I’ve a right to get as much out of ’em as I can, Mr.
 Bumble; and so—I think I’ll take the boy myself.”
 
 Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the
 building. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes;
 and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening “upon
 liking”—a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that
 if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out
 of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for
 a term of years, to do what he likes with.
 
 When little Oliver was taken before “the gentlemen” that evening; and
 informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a
 coffin-maker’s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever
 came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be
 drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so
 little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened
 young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.
 
 Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the
 world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror
 at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they
 were rather out, in this particular instance. The simple fact was, that
 Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too
 much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of
 brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He
 heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had
 his luggage put into his hand—which was not very difficult to carry,
 inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper
 parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep—he pulled his cap
 over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble’s coat
 cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.
 
 For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark;
 for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should:
 and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by
 the skirts of Mr. Bumble’s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to
 great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. As
 they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it
 expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for
 inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and
 becoming air of gracious patronage.
 
 “Oliver!” said Mr. Bumble.
 
 “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.
 
 “Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.”
 
 Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of
 his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them
 when he looked up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon
 him, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another.
 The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.
 Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble’s he covered his face with
 both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and
 bony fingers.
 
 “Well!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little
 charge a look of intense malignity. “Well! Of _all_ the ungratefullest,
 and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the—”
 
 “No, no, sir,” sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the
 well-known cane; “no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I
 will, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so—so—”
 
 “So what?” inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.
 
 “So lonely, sir! So very lonely!” cried the child. “Everybody hates me.
 Oh! sir, don’t, don’t pray be cross to me!” The child beat his hand
 upon his heart; and looked in his companion’s face, with tears of real
 agony.
 
 Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver’s piteous and helpless look, with some
 astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky
 manner; and after muttering something about “that troublesome cough,”
 bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his
 hand, he walked on with him in silence.
 
 The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was
 making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate
 dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.
 
 “Aha!” said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in
 the middle of a word; “is that you, Bumble?”
 
 “No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,” replied the beadle. “Here! I’ve brought
 the boy.” Oliver made a bow.
 
 “Oh! that’s the boy, is it?” said the undertaker: raising the candle
 above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. “Mrs. Sowerberry, will
 you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?”
 
 Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and
 presented the form of a short, thin, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish
 countenance.
 
 “My dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, “this is the boy from
 the workhouse that I told you of.” Oliver bowed again.
 
 “Dear me!” said the undertaker’s wife, “he’s very small.”
 
 “Why, he _is_ rather small,” replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as
 if it were his fault that he was no bigger; “he is small. There’s no
 denying it. But he’ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry—he’ll grow.”
 
 “Ah! I dare say he will,” replied the lady pettishly, “on our victuals
 and our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they
 always cost more to keep, than they’re worth. However, men always think
 they know best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o’ bones.” With this,
 the undertaker’s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a
 steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the
 ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated “kitchen”; wherein sat a
 slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very
 much out of repair.
 
 “Here, Charlotte,” said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,
 “give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He
 hasn’t come home since the morning, so he may go without ’em. I dare
 say the boy isn’t too dainty to eat ’em—are you, boy?”
 
 Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was
 trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a
 plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.
 
 I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall
 within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen
 Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.
 I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver
 tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only
 one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the
 Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.
 
 “Well,” said the undertaker’s wife, when Oliver had finished his
 supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful
 auguries of his future appetite: “have you done?”
 
 There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the
 affirmative.
 
 “Then come with me,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty
 lamp, and leading the way upstairs; “your bed’s under the counter. You
 don’t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn’t much
 matter whether you do or don’t, for you can’t sleep anywhere else.
 Come; don’t keep me here all night!”
 
 Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER V.
 OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST
 TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER’S BUSINESS
 
 
 Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker’s shop, set the lamp
 down on a workman’s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling
 of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be
 at no loss to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which
 stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a
 cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the
 direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see
 some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror.
 Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm
 boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like
 high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.
 Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black
 cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was
 ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff
 neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by
 four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and
 hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The
 recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust,
 looked like a grave.
 
 Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was
 alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the
 best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no
 friends to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no recent
 separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and
 well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.
 
 But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept
 into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be
 lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the
 tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep
 bell to soothe him in his sleep.
 
 Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of
 the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was
 repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.
 When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.
 
 “Open the door, will yer?” cried the voice which belonged to the legs
 which had kicked at the door.
 
 “I will, directly, sir,” replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning
 the key.
 
 “I suppose yer the new boy, ain’t yer?” said the voice through the
 key-hole.
 
 “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “How old are yer?” inquired the voice.
 
 “Ten, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Then I’ll whop yer when I get in,” said the voice; “you just see if I
 don’t, that’s all, my work’us brat!” and having made this obliging
 promise, the voice began to whistle.
 
 Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
 expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the
 smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would
 redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a
 trembling hand, and opened the door.
 
 For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street,
 and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had
 addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm
 himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post
 in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut
 into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then
 consumed with great dexterity.
 
 “I beg your pardon, sir,” said Oliver at length: seeing that no other
 visitor made his appearance; “did you knock?”
 
 “I kicked,” replied the charity-boy.
 
 “Did you want a coffin, sir?” inquired Oliver, innocently.
 
 At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver
 would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that
 way.
 
 “Yer don’t know who I am, I suppose, Work’us?” said the charity-boy, in
 continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with
 edifying gravity.
 
 “No, sir,” rejoined Oliver.
 
 “I’m Mister Noah Claypole,” said the charity-boy, “and you’re under me.
 Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!” With this, Mr.
 Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a
 dignified air, which did him great credit. It is difficult for a
 large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy
 countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more
 especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red
 nose and yellow smalls.
 
 Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in
 his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a
 small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the
 day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the
 assurance that “he’d catch it,” condescended to help him. Mr.
 Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry
 appeared. Oliver having “caught it,” in fulfilment of Noah’s
 prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.
 
 “Come near the fire, Noah,” said Charlotte. “I saved a nice little bit
 of bacon for you from master’s breakfast. Oliver, shut that door at
 Mister Noah’s back, and take them bits that I’ve put out on the cover
 of the bread-pan. There’s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink
 it there, and make haste, for they’ll want you to mind the shop. D’ye
 hear?”
 
 “D’ye hear, Work’us?” said Noah Claypole.
 
 “Lor, Noah!” said Charlotte, “what a rum creature you are! Why don’t
 you let the boy alone?”
 
 “Let him alone!” said Noah. “Why everybody lets him alone enough, for
 the matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever
 interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty
 well. Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!”
 
 “Oh, you queer soul!” said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in
 which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully
 at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest
 corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially
 reserved for him.
 
 Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance-child was
 he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents,
 who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a
 drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of
 twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the
 neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public
 streets, with the ignominious epithets of “leathers,” “charity,” and
 the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune
 had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could
 point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This
 affords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful
 thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same
 amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest
 charity-boy.
 
 Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker’s some three weeks or a
 month. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry—the shop being shut up—were taking their
 supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several
 deferential glances at his wife, said,
 
 “My dear—” He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up,
 with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.
 
 “Well,” said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.
 
 “Nothing, my dear, nothing,” said Mr. Sowerberry.
 
 “Ugh, you brute!” said Mrs. Sowerberry.
 
 “Not at all, my dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. “I thought you
 didn’t want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say—”
 
 “Oh, don’t tell me what you were going to say,” interposed Mrs.
 Sowerberry. “I am nobody; don’t consult me, pray. _I_ don’t want to
 intrude upon your secrets.” As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an
 hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.
 
 “But, my dear,” said Sowerberry, “I want to ask your advice.”
 
 “No, no, don’t ask mine,” replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting
 manner: “ask somebody else’s.” Here, there was another hysterical
 laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common
 and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very
 effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special
 favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to
 hear. After a short duration, the permission was most graciously
 conceded.
 
 “It’s only about young Twist, my dear,” said Mr. Sowerberry. “A very
 good-looking boy, that, my dear.”
 
 “He need be, for he eats enough,” observed the lady.
 
 “There’s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,” resumed Mr.
 Sowerberry, “which is very interesting. He would make a delightful
 mute, my love.”
 
 Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable
 wonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for
 any observation on the good lady’s part, proceeded.
 
 “I don’t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but
 only for children’s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in
 proportion, my dear. You may depend upon it, it would have a superb
 effect.”
 
 Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way,
 was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been
 compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances,
 she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious
 suggestion had not presented itself to her husband’s mind before? Mr.
 Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his
 proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should
 be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this
 view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of
 his services being required.
 
 The occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next
 morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against
 the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he
 selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.
 
 “Aha!” said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance;
 “an order for a coffin, eh?”
 
 “For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,” replied Mr.
 Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like
 himself, was very corpulent.
 
 “Bayton,” said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.
 Bumble. “I never heard the name before.”
 
 Bumble shook his head, as he replied, “Obstinate people, Mr.
 Sowerberry; very obstinate. Proud, too, I’m afraid, sir.”
 
 “Proud, eh?” exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. “Come, that’s too
 much.”
 
 “Oh, it’s sickening,” replied the beadle. “Antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!”
 
 “So it is,” acquiesced the undertaker.
 
 “We only heard of the family the night before last,” said the beadle;
 “and we shouldn’t have known anything about them, then, only a woman
 who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial
 committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was
 very bad. He had gone out to dinner; but his ’prentice (which is a very
 clever lad) sent ’em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.”
 
 “Ah, there’s promptness,” said the undertaker.
 
 “Promptness, indeed!” replied the beadle. “But what’s the consequence;
 what’s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband
 sends back word that the medicine won’t suit his wife’s complaint, and
 so she shan’t take it—says she shan’t take it, sir! Good, strong,
 wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish
 labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before—sent ’em for nothing,
 with a blackin’-bottle in,—and he sends back word that she shan’t take
 it, sir!”
 
 As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble’s mind in full force, he
 struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with
 indignation.
 
 “Well,” said the undertaker, “I ne—ver—did—”
 
 “Never did, sir!” ejaculated the beadle. “No, nor nobody never did; but
 now she’s dead, we’ve got to bury her; and that’s the direction; and
 the sooner it’s done, the better.”
 
 Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a
 fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.
 
 “Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!”
 said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the
 street.
 
 “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of
 sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at
 the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble’s voice.
 
 He needn’t haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble’s glance,
 however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman
 in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that
 now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better
 avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years,
 and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish
 should be thus effectually and legally overcome.
 
 “Well,” said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, “the sooner this job is
 done, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap,
 and come with me.” Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his
 professional mission.
 
 They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely
 inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street
 more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused
 to look for the house which was the object of their search. The houses
 on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by
 people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have
 sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the
 squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies
 half doubled, occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements
 had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only
 the upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure
 from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by
 huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the
 road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the
 nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards
 which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their
 positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human
 body. The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The very rats, which here and
 there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine.
 
 There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver
 and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark
 passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the
 undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling
 against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.
 
 It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker
 at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the
 apartment to which he had been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed
 him.
 
 There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically,
 over the empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the
 cold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged
 children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door,
 there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.
 Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept
 involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the
 boy felt that it was a corpse.
 
 The man’s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly;
 his eyes were bloodshot. The old woman’s face was wrinkled; her two
 remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright
 and piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They
 seemed so like the rats he had seen outside.
 
 “Nobody shall go near her,” said the man, starting fiercely up, as the
 undertaker approached the recess. “Keep back! Damn you, keep back, if
 you’ve a life to lose!”
 
 “Nonsense, my good man,” said the undertaker, who was pretty well used
 to misery in all its shapes. “Nonsense!”
 
 “I tell you,” said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously
 on the floor,—“I tell you I won’t have her put into the ground. She
 couldn’t rest there. The worms would worry her—not eat her—she is so
 worn away.”
 
 The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape
 from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.
 
 “Ah!” said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at
 the feet of the dead woman; “kneel down, kneel down—kneel round her,
 every one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death. I
 never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her
 bones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor
 candle; she died in the dark—in the dark! She couldn’t even see her
 children’s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged
 for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back,
 she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they
 starved her to death. I swear it before the God that saw it! They
 starved her!” He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream,
 rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering
 his lips.
 
 The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had
 hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that
 passed, menaced them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the
 man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the
 undertaker.
 
 “She was my daughter,” said the old woman, nodding her head in the
 direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more
 ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. “Lord, Lord!
 Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman
 then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and
 stiff! Lord, Lord!—to think of it; it’s as good as a play—as good as a
 play!”
 
 As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment,
 the undertaker turned to go away.
 
 “Stop, stop!” said the old woman in a loud whisper. “Will she be buried
 to-morrow, or next day, or to-night? I laid her out; and I must walk,
 you know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter
 cold. We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send
 some bread—only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some
 bread, dear?” she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker’s coat, as
 he once more moved towards the door.
 
 “Yes, yes,” said the undertaker,”of course. Anything you like!” He
 disengaged himself from the old woman’s grasp; and, drawing Oliver
 after him, hurried away.
 
 The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a
 half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble
 himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where
 Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the
 workhouse, who were to act as bearers. An old black cloak had been
 thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin
 having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers,
 and carried into the street.
 
 “Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!” whispered
 Sowerberry in the old woman’s ear; “we are rather late; and it won’t
 do, to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,—as quick as you
 like!”
 
 Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the
 two mourners kept as near them, as they could. Mr. Bumble and
 Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs
 were not so long as his master’s, ran by the side.
 
 There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had
 anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the
 churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were
 made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by
 the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it
 might be an hour or so, before he came. So, they put the bier on the
 brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp
 clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the
 spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at
 hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by
 jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and
 Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him,
 and read the paper.
 
 At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,
 and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.
 Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice
 as he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up
 appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the
 burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his
 surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.
 
 “Now, Bill!” said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. “Fill up!”
 
 It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the
 uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The grave-digger
 shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet:
 shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who
 murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.
 
 “Come, my good fellow!” said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. “They
 want to shut up the yard.”
 
 The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the
 grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had
 addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a
 swoon. The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss
 of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any
 attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came
 to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed
 on their different ways.
 
 “Well, Oliver,” said Sowerberry, as they walked home, “how do you like
 it?”
 
 “Pretty well, thank you, sir” replied Oliver, with considerable
 hesitation. “Not very much, sir.”
 
 “Ah, you’ll get used to it in time, Oliver,” said Sowerberry. “Nothing
 when you _are_ used to it, my boy.”
 
 Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time
 to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask
 the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had
 seen and heard.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER VI.
 OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND
 RATHER ASTONISHES HIM
 
 
 The month’s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice
 sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were
 looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great
 deal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberry’s ingenious
 speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest
 inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so
 prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful
 processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to
 his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the
 mothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his
 adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity
 of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a
 finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the
 beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded
 people bear their trials and losses.
 
 For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich
 old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews
 and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous
 illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most
 public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need
 be—quite cheerful and contented—conversing together with as much
 freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb
 them. Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic
 calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far
 from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to
 render it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable,
 too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during
 the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached
 home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. All
 this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with
 great admiration.
 
 That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good
 people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm
 with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for
 many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and
 ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now
 that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the
 black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in
 the muffin-cap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah
 did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry
 was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and
 a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as
 comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in
 the grain department of a brewery.
 
 And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver’s history; for I
 have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,
 but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future
 prospects and proceedings.
 
 One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual
 dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton—a pound and a half
 of the worst end of the neck—when Charlotte being called out of the
 way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being
 hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a
 worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.
 
 Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the
 table-cloth; and pulled Oliver’s hair; and twitched his ears; and
 expressed his opinion that he was a “sneak”; and furthermore announced
 his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable
 event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty
",OliverTwist
5," 
 I wanted to stop my ears and tell them to get out. I had asked for
 competent servants, and understood that competent servants bought or
 hired whatever was necessary for their work. That was the way things
 were managed at home. But then my cook had been with me for eight years
 and my housemaid for eleven. They knew my ways, and that I was never to
 be bothered with household details, only the bills were my affair. And
 those my secretary paid.
 
 “It was one of them there writing women as had the place last, with no
 more idea of order than the kitchen cat,” cook said indignantly, or
 perhaps suspiciously, eyeing the writing-table. I had come here for rest
 and change, to lead the simple life, with two servants instead of five
 and everything in proportion. Now I found myself giving reckless orders.
 
 “Buy everything you want; there is sure to be a shop in the village. If
 not, make out a list, and one of you go up to the Stores or Harrod’s. If
 the place is dirty get in a charwoman. Some one will recommend you a
 charwoman, the house-agent or the doctor.” I reminded cook that she was
 a cook-housekeeper, but failed to subdue her.
 
 “You can’t be cook-housekeeper in a desert island. I call it no better
 than a desert island. I’d get hold of that there house-agent that
 engaged us if I was you. He said the ’ouse was well-found. Him with his
 well-found ’ouse! They’re bound to give you what you need, but if you
 don’t mind expense....”
 
 Of course I minded expense, never more so than now when I saw the
 possibility before me of a long period of inaction.... But I minded
 other things more. Household detail for instance, and uneducated voices.
 I compromised and sanctioned the appeal to the house-agent, confirming
 that the irreducible minimum was to be purchased, explaining I was ill,
 not to be troubled about this sort of thing. I brushed aside a few
 “buts” and finally rid myself of them. I caught myself yearning for
 Ella, who would have saved me this and every trouble. Then scorned my
 desire to send for her and determined to be glad of my solitude, to
 rejoice in my freedom. I could look as ill as I liked without comment. I
 could sit where I was without attempting to tidy my belongings, and no
 one would ask me if I felt seedy, if the pain was coming on, if they
 could do anything for me. And then, fool that I was, I remember tears
 coming to my eyes because I was lonely, and sure that I had tired out
 even Ella’s patience. I wondered how any one could face a long illness,
 least of all any one like me who loved work, and above all independence,
 freedom. I knew, I knew even then that the time was coming when I could
 neither work nor be independent; the shadow was upon me that very first
 afternoon at Carbies. When I could see to write I dashed off a postcard
 to Ella telling her I was quite well and she was not to bother about me.
 
 “I like the place, I’m sure I shall be able to write here. Don’t think
 of coming down, and keep the rest of the family off me if you can....”
 
 I spent the remainder of the evening weakly longing for her, and feeling
 that she need not have taken me at my word, that she might have come
 with me although I urged her not, that she should have understood me
 better.
 
 That night I took less nepenthe, yet saw Margaret Capel more vividly.
 She stayed a long time too. This time she wore a blue peignoir, her hair
 down, and she looked very young and girlish. There were gnomes and
 fairies when she went, and after that the sea, swish and awash as if I
 had been upon a yacht. Unconsciousness only came to me when the yacht
 was submerged in a great wave ... semi-consciousness.
 
 But I am not telling the story of my illness. I should like to, but I
 fear it would have no interest for the general public, or for the young
 people amongst whom one looks for readers. I have sometimes thought
 nevertheless, both then and afterwards, that there must be a public who
 would like to hear what one does and thinks and suffers when illness
 catches one unawares; and all life’s interests alter and narrow down to
 temperatures and medicine-time, to fighting or submitting to nurses and
 weakness, to hatred and contempt of doctors, and a dumb blind rage
 against fate; to pain and the soporifics behind which its hold tightens.
 
 Pineland did not cure me, although I spent hours in the open air and let
 my pens lie resting in their case. Under continual pains I grew sullen
 and resentful, always more ill-tempered and desirous of solitude. Dr.
 Kennedy called frequently. Sometimes I saw him and sometimes not, as the
 mood took me. He never came without speaking of the former occupant of
 the house, of Margaret Capel. He seemed to take very little personal
 interest in me or my condition. And I was too proud (or stupid) to force
 it on his notice. I asked him once, crudely enough, if he had been in
 love with Margaret Capel. He answered quite simply, as if he had been a
 child:
 
 “One had no chance. From the first I knew there was no chance.”
 
 “There was some one else?”
 
 “He came up and down. I seldom met him. Then there were the
 circumstances. She was between the Nisi and the Absolute, the nether and
 the upper stone....”
 
 “Oh, yes, I remember now. She was divorced.”
 
 “No, she was not. She divorced her husband,” he answered quite sharply
 and a little distressed. “Courts of Justice they are called, but Courts
 of Injustice would be a better name. They put her to the question, on
 the rack; no inquisition could have been worse. And she was broken by
 it....”
 
 “But there was some one else, you said yourself there was some one else.
 Probably these probing questions, this rack, were her deserts.
 Personally I am a monogamist,” I retorted. Not that I was really narrow
 or a Pharisee, only in contentious mood and cruel under the pressure of
 my own harrow. “Probably anything she suffered served her right,” I
 added indifferently.
 
 “It all happened afterwards. I thought you knew,” he said incoherently.
 
 “I know nothing except that you are always talking of Margaret Capel,
 and I am a little tired of the subject,” I answered pettishly. “Who was
 the man?”
 
 “The man!”
 
 “Yes, the man who came up and down to see her?”
 
 “Gabriel Stanton.”
 
 “Gabriel Stanton!” I sat upright in my chair; that really startled me.
 “Gabriel Stanton,” I repeated, and then, stupidly enough: “Are you
 sure?”
 
 “Quite sure. But I won’t talk about it any more since it bores you. The
 house is so haunted for me, and you seemed so sympathetic, so
 interested. You won’t let me doctor you.”
 
 “You haven’t tried very hard, have you?”
 
 “You put me off whenever I try to ask you how you are, or any
 questions.”
 
 “What is the good? I’ve seen twelve London doctors.”
 
 “London has not the monopoly of talent.” He took up his hat, and then my
 hand.
 
 “Offended?” I asked him.
 
 “No. But my partner will be home tomorrow, and I’m relinquishing my
 place to him. It is really his case.”
 
 “I refuse to be anybody’s case. I’ve heard from the best authorities
 that no one knows anything about neuritis and that it is practically
 incurable. One has to suffer and suffer. Even Almroth Wright has not
 found the anti-bacilli. Nepenthe gives me ease; that is all the
 doctoring I want—ease!”
 
 “It is doing you a lot of harm. And what makes you think you’ve got
 neuritis?”
 
 “What ailed your Margaret?” I answered mockingly. “Did you ever find
 that out?”
 
 “No ... yes. Of course I knew.”
 
 “Did you ever examine her?” I was curious to know that; suddenly and
 inconsequently curious.
 
 “Why do you ask?” But his face changed, and I knew the question had been
 cruel or impertinent. He let go my hand abruptly, he had been holding it
 all this time. “I did all that any doctor could.” He was obviously
 distressed and I ashamed.
 
 “Don’t go yet. Sit down and have a cup of tea with me. I’ve been here
 three weeks and every meal has been solitary. Your Margaret”—I smiled at
 him then, knowing he would not understand—“comes to me sometimes at
 night with my nepenthe, but all day I am alone.”
 
 “By your own desire then, I swear. You are not a woman to be left alone
 if you wanted company.” He dropped into a chair, seemed glad to stay.
 Presently over tea and crumpets, we were really talking of my illness,
 and if I had permitted it I have no doubt he would have gone into the
 matter more closely. As it was he warned me solemnly against the
 nepenthe and suggested I should try codein as an alternative, a
 suggestion I ignored completely, unfortunately for myself.
 
 “Tell me about your partner,” I said, drinking my tea slowly.
 
 “Oh! you’ll like him, all the ladies like him. He is very spruce and
 rather handsome; dapper, band-boxy. Not tall, turning grey....”
 
 “Did she like him?” I persisted.
 
 “She would not have him near her. After his first visit she denied
 herself to him all the time. He used to talk to me about her, he could
 never understand it, he was not used to that sort of treatment, he is a
 tremendous favourite about here.”
 
 “What did she say of him?”
 
 “That he grinned like a Cheshire cat, talked in _clichés_, rubbed his
 hands and seemed glad when she suffered. He has a very cheerful bedside
 manner; most people like it.”
 
 “I quite understand. I won’t have him. Mind that; don’t send him to see
 me, because I won’t see him. I’d rather put up with you.” I have
 explained I was beyond convention. He really tried hard to persuade me,
 urged Dr. Lansdowne’s degrees and qualifications, his seniority. I grew
 angry in the end.
 
 “Surely I need not have either of you if I don’t want to. I suppose
 there are other doctors in the neighbourhood.”
 
 He gave me a list of the medical men practising in and about Pineland;
 it was not at all badly done, he praised everybody yet made me see them
 clearly. In the end I told him I would choose my own medical attendant
 when I wanted one.
 
 “Am I dismissed, then?” he asked.
 
 “Have you ever been summoned?” I answered in the same tone.
 
 “Seriously now, I’d like to be of use to you if you’d let me.”
 
 “In order to retain the _entrée_ to the house where the wonderful
 Margaret moved and had her being?”
 
 “No! Well, perhaps yes, partly. And you are a very attractive woman
 yourself.”
 
 “Don’t be ridiculous.”
 
 “It is quite true. I expect you know it.”
 
 “I’m over forty and ill. I suppose that is what you find attractive,
 that I am ill?”
 
 “I don’t think so. I hate hysterical women as a rule.”
 
 “Hysterical!”
 
 “With any form of nerve disease.”
 
 “Do you really think I am suffering from nerve disease? From the
 vapours?” I asked scornfully, thinking for the thousand and first time
 what a fool the man was.
 
 “You don’t occupy yourself?”
 
 “I’m one of the busiest women on God’s earth.”
 
 “I’ve never seen you doing anything, except sitting at her writing-table
 with two bone-dry pens set out and some blank paper. And you object to
 be questioned about your illness, or examined.”
 
 “I hate scientific doctoring. And then you have not inspired me with
 confidence, you are obsessed with one idea.”
 
 “I can’t help that. From the first you’ve reminded me of Margaret.”
 
 “Oh! damn Margaret Capel, and your infatuation for her! I’m sorry, but
 that’s the way I feel just now. I can’t escape from her, the whole place
 is full of her. And yet she hasn’t written a thing that will live. I
 sent to the London Library soon after I came and got all her books. I
 waded through the lot. Just epigram and paradox, a weak Bernard Shaw in
 petticoats.”
 
 “I never read a word she wrote,” he answered indifferently. “It was the
 woman herself....”
 
 “I am sure. Well, good-bye! I can’t talk any more tonight, I’m tired.
 Don’t send Dr. Lansdowne. If I want any one I’ll let you know.”
 
 Margaret came to me again that night when the house was quite silent and
 all the lights out except the red one from the fire. She sat in the
 easy-chair on the hearthrug, and for the first time I heard her speak.
 She was very young and feeble-looking, and I told her I was sorry I had
 been impatient and said “damn” about her.
 
 “But you are all over the place, you know. And I can’t write unless I am
 alone. I’m always solitary and never alone here; you haunt and obsess
 me. Can’t you go away? I don’t mean now. I am glad you are here now, and
 talking. Tell me about Dr. Kennedy. Did you care for him at all? Did you
 know he was in love with you?”
 
 “Peter Kennedy! No, I never thought about him at all, not until the end.
 Then he was very kind, or cruel. He did what I asked him. You know why I
 obsess you, don’t you? It used to be just the same with me when a
 subject was evolving. You are going to write my story; you will do it
 better in a way than I could have done it myself, although worse in
 another. I have left you all the material.”
 
 “Not a word.”
 
 “You haven’t found it yet. I put it together myself, the day Gabriel
 sent back my letters. You will have my diary and a few notes....”
 
 “Where?”
 
 “In a drawer in the writing-table. But it is only half there.... You
 will have to add to it.”
 
 “I see you quite well when I keep my eyes shut. If I open them the room
 sways and you are not there. Why should I write your life? I am no
 historian, only a novelist.”
 
 “I know, but you are on the spot, with all the material and local
 colour. You know Gabriel too; we used to speak about you.”
 
 “He is no admirer of mine.”
 
 “No. He is a great stylist, and you have no sense of style.”
 
 “Nor you of anything else,” I put in rudely, hastily.
 
 “A harsh judgment, characteristic. You are a blunt realist, I should
 say, hard and a little unwomanly, calling a spade by its ugliest name;
 but sentimental with pen in hand you really do write abominably
 sometimes. But you will remind the world of me again. I don’t want to be
 forgotten. I would rather be misrepresented than forgotten. There are so
 few geniuses! Keats and I.... _Don’t go to sleep._”
 
 I could not help it, however. Several times after that, whenever I
 remembered something I wished to ask her, and opened dulled eyes, she
 was not there at all. The chair where she had sat was empty, and the
 fire had died down to dull ash. I drowsed and dreamed. In my dreams I
 achieved style, an ambient, exquisite style, and wrote about Margaret
 Capel and Gabriel Stanton so glowingly and convincingly that all the
 world wept for them and wondered, and my sales ran into hundreds of
 thousands.
 
 “_We have always expected great things of this author, but she has
 transcended our highest expectations...._” The reviews were all on this
 scale. For the remainder of that night no writer in England was as
 famous as I. Publishers and literary agents hung round my doorsteps and
 I rejected marvellous offers. If I had not been so thirsty and my mouth
 dry, no one could have been happier, but the dryness and thirst woke me
 continuously, and I execrated Suzanne for having put the water bottle
 out of my reach, and forgotten to supply me with acid drops. I remember
 grumbling about it to Margaret.
 
 
 
 
                                CHAPTER II
 
 
 I began the search for those letters the very next day, knowing how
 absurd it was, as if one were still a child who expected to find the pot
 of gold at the end of the rainbow. I made Suzanne telephone to Dr.
 Kennedy that I was much better and would prefer he did not call. I
 really wanted to be alone, to make my search complete, not to be
 interrupted. If it were not true that I was better, at least I was no
 worse, only heavy and dull in body and mind, every movement an almost
 unbearable fatigue. Nevertheless I sat down with determination at the
 writing-table, intent on opening every drawer and cupboard, calling to
 Suzanne to help me, on the pretence of wanting white paper to line the
 drawers, and a duster to clean them. In reality, that she should do the
 stooping instead of me. But everywhere was emptiness or dust. I crawled
 to the music room after lunch and tried my luck there, amid the heaped
 disorderly music, but there too the search proved unavailing. It was no
 use going downstairs again, so I went to bed, before dinner, passing a
 white night with red pain points, beyond the reach even of nepenthe. I
 had counted on seeing Margaret Capel again, getting fuller instructions,
 but was disappointed in that also.
 
 The next day and many others were equally full and equally empty. I
 looked in unlikely places until I was tired out; dragging about my
 worn-out body that had been whipped into a pretence of activity by my
 driving brain. Dr. Kennedy came and went, talking spasmodically of
 Margaret Capel, watching me, I thought sometimes, with puzzled enquiring
 eyes. My family in London was duly informed how well I was, and the good
 that the rest and solitude were doing me. I felt horribly ill, and
 towards the end of my second week gave up seeking for Margaret Capel’s
 letters or papers. I was still intent upon writing her story, but had
 made up my mind now to compile it from the facts I could persuade or
 force from Dr. Kennedy, from old newspaper reports, and other sources.
 It was borne in upon me that to go on with my work was the only way to
 save myself from what I now thought was mental as well as physical
 breakdown. I saw Margaret elusively, was never quite free from the sense
 that I was not alone. The chills that ran through me meant that she was
 behind me; the hot flushes that she was about to materialise. In normal
 times I was the most dogmatic disbeliever in the occult; but now I
 believed Carbies to be haunted.
 
 When I was able to think soundly and consecutively, I began to piece
 together what little I knew of these two people by whom I was obsessed.
 For it was not only Margaret, but Gabriel Stanton whom I felt, or
 suspected, about the house. Stanton & Co. were my own publishers. I had
 not known them as Margaret Capel’s. Gabriel was not the member of the
 firm I saw when I made my rare calls in Greyfriars’ Square. He was
 understood to be occupied only with the classical works issued by the
 well-known house. Somewhere or other I had heard that he had achieved a
 great reputation at Oxford and knew more about Greek roots than any
 living authority. On the few occasions we met I had felt him
 antagonistic or contemptuous. He would come into the room where I was
 talking to Sir George and back out again quickly, saying he was sorry,
 or that he did not know his cousin was engaged. Sir George introduced us
 more than once, but Mr. Gabriel Stanton always seemed to have forgotten
 the circumstance. I remembered him as a tall thin man, with deep-set
 eyes and sunken mouth, a gentleman, as all the Stantons were, but as
 different as possible from his genial partner. I had, I have, a soft
 spot in my heart for Sir George Stanton, and had met with much kindness
 from him. Gabriel, too, may have had a charm—they were notoriously a
 charming family,—but he had not exerted it for my benefit. He and all of
 them were so respectable, so traditionally and inalienably respectable,
 that it was difficult to readjust my slowly working mind and think of
 him as any woman’s lover; illegitimate lover, as he seemed to be in this
 case. I wrote to my secretary in London to look up everything that was
 known about Margaret Capel. Before her reply came I had another attack
 of pleurisy—I had had several in London,—and this brought Ella to me, to
 say nothing of various hungry and impotent London consultants.
 
 As I said before, this is not a history of my illness, nor of my
 sister’s encompassing love that ultimately enabled me to weather it,
 that forced me again and again from the arms of Death, that friend for
 whom at times my weakness yearned. The fight was all from the outside.
 As for me, I laid down my weapons early. I dreaded pain more than death,
 and do still, the passing through and not the arrival, writhing under
 the shame of my beaten body, wanting to hide. Yet publicity beat upon
 me, streamed into the room like midday sun. There were bulletins in the
 papers and the Press Association rang up and asked for late and early
 news. Obituary notices were probably being prepared. Everybody knew that
 at which I was still only guessing. It irked me sometimes to know they
 would be only paragraphs and not columns, and I knew Ella would be
 vexed.
 
 When the acuteness of this particular attack subsided I thought again of
 Margaret Capel and Gabriel Stanton, yet could not talk of them. For Ella
 knew nothing of the former occupants of the house, and for some
 inexplicable reason Dr. Kennedy had left off coming. His partner, or
 substitute, whose Cheshire-cat grin I easily recognised, made no secret,
 notwithstanding his cheerfulness, of the desperate view he took of my
 condition. I hated his futile fruitless examinations, the consultations
 whereat I was sure he aired his provincial self-importance, his great
 cool hands on my pulse and smug dogmatic ignorance. “The pain is just
 here,” he would announce, but not even by accident did he ever once hit
 upon the right spot.
 
 Fortunately Ella was there. She must have arrived many days before I
 recognised her. The household was moving on oiled wheels, my meals were
 brought me now on trays with delicate napery and a flower or two. Scent
 sprays and early strawberries, down pillows and Jaegar sheets, a water
 bed presently, and all the luxuries, told me undeniably she was in the
 vicinity. I had always known how it would be. That once I admitted to
 helplessness she would give up her home life and all the joys of her
 well-filled days, and would live for me only. Because her tenderness for
 me met mine for her and was too poignant for my growing weakness, I had
 denied us both. Her the joy of giving and myself of taking. Now, without
 acknowledgment or word of gratitude, I accepted all.
 
 “Don’t go away,” were the first words I said to her. I! who had begged
 her so hard not to come, repudiated her anxiety so violently.
 
 “Of course not. Why should I? I always like the country in the early
 spring,” she answered coolly. “Do you want anything?” She came nearer to
 the bed.
 
 “What has become of Dr. Kennedy?” I asked.
 
 “I thought you did not like him. Suzanne told me that often you would
 not see him when he called. And you were quite right. It was evident he
 did not know what was the matter with you.”
 
 “No one does.”
 
 “You have not helped us.” Her eyelids were pink, but otherwise she did
 not reproach me.
 
 “And now I am going to die, I suppose.”
 
 “Die! You are not going to die; don’t be so absurd. I wouldn’t let you,
 for one thing. And why should you? People don’t die of pleurisy, or
 neuritis. You are better today than you were yesterday, and you will be
 better still tomorrow. I know.”
 
 Outside the room she may have wept, for, as I said, her eyelids were
 pink. Inside it she was all quiet confidence and courage.
 
 “I want Dr. Kennedy. Get him back to me.” I did not argue with her
 whether I would live or die, it was too futile.
 
 “This man Lansdowne is F.R.C.S. and M.D. London,” she reminded me.
 
 “I don’t care if he’s all the letters of the alphabet. He grins at me,
 talks smugly, patronises me, pats my shoulder. He will send his carriage
 to follow the funeral. I see in his face that he has made up his mind to
 it.”
 
 Nurse interfered and said that Dr. Lansdowne was most able.
 
 “Send her out of the room.” I was impatient at her interference.
 
 “All right, nurse, I’ll sit with Mrs. Vevaseur until you’ve had your
 dinner. You won’t talk too much?” she said to me imploringly.
 
 “Perhaps,” I answered, and smiled. It was good to have Ella sitting with
 me again.
 
 “The doctor did not wish her to speak at all, nor to see visitors.”
 
 I don’t know how Ella managed to get that authoritative white-capped
 female out of the room, but she did; she had infinite tact and resource.
 
 “Shall I get my needlework? Or would you rather I read to you? You
 really mustn’t talk.”
 
 “Neither. You are not going away?”
 
 “I am staying as long as you want me.”
 
 Not a word about the times when I had told her brutally to let me alone,
 when I had almost turned her out of the house in London, finally fled
 from her here. That was Ella all over, and characteristic of me that I
 could not even thank her. When she said she would stay it seemed too
 good to be true. I questioned her about her responsibilities.
 
 “What about Violet and Tommy, the paper?” For Ella, too, was bound on
 the Ixion wheel of the weekly press.
 
 “It’s all right; everything has been arranged, in the best possible way.
 I am quite free. I shan’t go away until you ask me to go.”
 
 Then I began to cry, in my great weakness, but hid my eyes, for I knew
 my tears would hurt her. I gave way only for a moment. It was such a
 relief to know her there, to feel I was being cared for. Paid service is
 only for the sound.
 
 Ella pretended not to notice my little breakdown, although she was not
 far off it herself. She began to talk of indifferent things. Who had
 telegraphed, or rung up; she told me that the news of my illness had
 been in the papers. All my good friends whom I had avoided during those
 dreary months had forgotten they had been snubbed and came forward with
 genuine sympathy and offers of help. I soon stopped her from telling me
 about them. It made me feel ashamed and unworthy. I could not recollect
 ever having done anything for anybody.
 
 “About getting Dr. Kennedy back?”
 
 “He neglected you disgracefully; wrote me lightly. I don’t wonder you
",Twilight
6," “You did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view,
 for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your
 reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.
 Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,
 and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular
 which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that
 the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with
 the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where
 there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.
 As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the
 present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events
 is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
 Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence
 your narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has
 not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the
 story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.
 As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of
 events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar
 cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to
 admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”
 
 The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
 little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside
 pocket of his great-coat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,
 with his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his
 knee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after the fashion
 of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by
 his dress or appearance.
 
 I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore
 every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,
 pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray shepherd’s check trousers,
 a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab
 waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of
 metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown
 overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
 Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man
 save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
 discontent upon his features.
 
 Sherlock Holmes’s quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his
 head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the
 obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes
 snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he
 has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing
 else.”
 
 Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the
 paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
 
 “How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?”
 he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labor. It’s
 as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”
 
 “Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than
 your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”
 
 “Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”
 
 “I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
 especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use
 an arc-and-compass breastpin.”
 
 “Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”
 
 “What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five
 inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you
 rest it upon the desk.”
 
 “Well, but China?”
 
 “The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist
 could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo
 marks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.
 That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite
 peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from
 your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”
 
 Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought
 at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was
 nothing in it, after all.”
 
 “I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in
 explaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor little
 reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can
 you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”
 
 “Yes, I have got it now,” he answered, with his thick, red finger
 planted half-way down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it
 all. You just read it for yourself, sir.”
 
 I took the paper from him, and read as follows:
 
   “TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the
   late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now
   another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League
   to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services. All
   red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above
   the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on
   Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of
   the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.”
 
 “What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated, after I had twice read
 over the extraordinary announcement.
 
 Holmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in
 high spirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said
 he. “And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about
 yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had
 upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, doctor, of the paper
 and the date.”
 
 “It is _The Morning Chronicle_, of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”
 
 “Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”
 
 “Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”
 said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s
 business at Coburg Square, near the city. It’s not a very large affair,
 and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I
 used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I
 would have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half
 wages, so as to learn the business.”
 
 “What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.
 
 “His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s
 hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;
 and I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what
 I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I
 put ideas in his head?”
 
 “Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who
 comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among
 employers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as
 remarkable as your advertisement.”
 
 “Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow
 for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be
 improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit
 into its hole to develope his pictures. That is his main fault; but, on
 the whole, he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”
 
 “He is still with you, I presume?”
 
 “Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking,
 and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a
 widower, and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three
 of us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do
 nothing more.
 
 “The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he
 came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very
 paper in his hand, and he says:
 
 “‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’
 
 “‘Why that?’ I asks.
 
 “‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the
 Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets
 it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,
 so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.
 If my hair would only change color, here’s a nice little crib all ready
 for me to step into.’
 
 “‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very
 stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having
 to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the
 door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,
 and I was always glad of a bit of news.
 
 “‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked,
 with his eyes open.
 
 “‘Never.’
 
 “‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the
 vacancies.’
 
 “‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.
 
 “‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it
 need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’
 
 “Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the
 business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of
 hundred would have been very handy.
 
 “‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.
 
 “‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for
 yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address
 where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the
 League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who
 was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a
 great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found
 that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with
 instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to
 men whose hair is of that color. From all I hear it is splendid pay,
 and very little to do.’
 
 “‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would
 apply.’
 
 “‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really
 confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from
 London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.
 Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is
 light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery
 red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;
 but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of
 the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’
 
 “Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my
 hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if
 there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance
 as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so
 much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered
 him to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me.
 He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and
 started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
 
 “I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
 north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his
 hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet
 Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked
 like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were
 so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single
 advertisement. Every shade of color they were—straw, lemon, orange,
 brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were
 not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how many
 were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would
 not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and
 pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to
 the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the
 stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we
 wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.”
 
 “Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes, as
 his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.
 “Pray continue your very interesting statement.”
 
 “There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a
 deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even
 redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came
 up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would
 disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy
 matter, after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was much
 more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door
 as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.
 
 “‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to
 fill a vacancy in the League.’
 
 “‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every
 requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He
 took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair
 until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my
 hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.
 
 “‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am
 sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized
 my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.
 ‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he, as he released me. ‘I perceive
 that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have
 twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales
 of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped
 over to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that
 the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,
 and the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was
 not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.
 
 “‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the
 pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a
 married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’
 
 “I answered that I had not.
 
 “His face fell immediately.
 
 “‘Dear me!’ he said, gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry
 to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation
 and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is
 exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’
 
 “My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not
 to have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few
 minutes, he said that it would be all right.
 
 “‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but
 we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as
 yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’
 
 “‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.
 
 “‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I
 shall be able to look after that for you.’
 
 “‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.
 
 “‘Ten to two.’
 
 “Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,
 especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;
 so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.
 Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see
 to anything that turned up.
 
 “‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’
 
 “‘Is £4 a week.’
 
 “‘And the work?’
 
 “‘Is purely nominal.’
 
 “‘What do you call purely nominal?’
 
 “‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the
 whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.
 The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the
 conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’
 
 “‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said
 I.
 
 “‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross, ‘neither sickness nor
 business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your
 billet.’
 
 “‘And the work?’
 
 “‘Is to copy out the “Encyclopædia Britannica.” There is the first
 volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
 blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready
 to-morrow?’
 
 “‘Certainly,’ I answered.
 
 “‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once
 more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to
 gain.’ He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant,
 hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good
 fortune.
 
 “Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in
 low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole
 affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might
 be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that any one
 could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing
 anything so simple as copying out the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica.’
 Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I
 had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning
 I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle
 of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I
 started off for Pope’s Court.
 
 “Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.
 The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to
 see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and
 then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all
 was right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me
 upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office
 after me.
 
 “This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager
 came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work.
 It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning
 I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
 Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after
 a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
 leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
 and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
 not risk the loss of it.
 
 “Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
 Archery and Armor and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence
 that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something
 in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.
 And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”
 
 “To an end?”
 
 “Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
 at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
 of card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
 it is, and you can read for yourself.”
 
 He held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of
 note-paper. It read in this fashion:
 
   “THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
    IS
    DISSOLVED.
    _October 9, 1890._”
 
 Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
 face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
 overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
 of laughter.
 
 “I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,
 flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing
 better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”
 
 “No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
 had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is
 most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
 so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
 take when you found the card upon the door?”
 
 “I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at
 the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
 Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
 ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
 the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
 body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
 name was new to him.
 
 [Illustration: “THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED”]
 
 “‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’
 
 “‘What, the red-headed man?’
 
 “‘Yes.’
 
 “‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor, and
 was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
 were ready. He moved out yesterday.’
 
 “‘Where could I find him?’
 
 “‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
 Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’
 
 “I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
 manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
 either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”
 
 “And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.
 
 “I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
 assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
 if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
 Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
 as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
 who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”
 
 “And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly
 remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
 have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
 it than might at first sight appear.”
 
 “Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a
 week.”
 
 “As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not
 see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
 the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £30, to say
 nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
 which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”
 
 “No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
 their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It
 was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
 pounds.”
 
 “We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
 or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
 your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”
 
 “About a month then.”
 
 “How did he come?”
 
 “In answer to an advertisement.”
 
 “Was he the only applicant?”
 
 “No, I had a dozen.”
 
 “Why did you pick him?”
 
 “Because he was handy, and would come cheap.”
 
 “At half-wages, in fact.”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”
 
 “Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
 though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
 forehead.”
 
 Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as
 much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
 earrings?”
 
 “Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a
 lad.”
 
 “Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with
 you?”
 
 “Oh yes, sir; I have only just left him.”
 
 “And has your business been attended to in your absence?”
 
 “Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a
 morning.”
 
 “That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
 the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
 hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”
 
 “Well, Watson,” said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, “what do you
 make of it all?”
 
 “I make nothing of it,” I answered, frankly. “It is a most mysterious
 business.”
 
 “As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less
 mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
 which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
 difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”
 
 “What are you going to do, then?” I asked.
 
 “To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg
 that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up
 in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
 there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
 like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
 he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
 sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
 mind, and put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.
 
 “Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked.
 “What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few
 hours?”
 
 “I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”
 
 “Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the city first, and
 we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal
 of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than
 Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come
 along!”
 
 We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk
 took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we
 had listened to in the morning. It was a pokey, little, shabby-genteel
 place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out
 into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and
 a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a
 smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown
 board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner
 house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his
 business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one
 side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between
 puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again
 to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned
 to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement
 with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.
 It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow,
 who asked him to step in.
 
 “Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go
 from here to the Strand.”
 
 “Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant, promptly, closing
 the door.
 
 “Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes, as we walked away. “He is, in my
 judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not
 sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him
 before.”
 
 “Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in
 this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your
 way merely in order that you might see him.”
 
 “Not him.”
 
 “What then?”
 
 “The knees of his trousers.”
 
 “And what did you see?”
 
 “What I expected to see.”
 
 “Why did you beat the pavement?”
 
 “My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are
 spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.
 Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”
 
 The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner
 from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to
 it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main
 arteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west.
 The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing
 in a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black
 with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize
 as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises
 that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant
 square which we had just quitted.
 
 “Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along
 the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.
 It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is
 Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg
 branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and
 McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the
 other block. And now, doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had
 some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,
 where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
 red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”
 
 My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
 very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the
 afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,
 gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his
 gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those
 of Holmes, the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,
 ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his
 singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and
 his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often
 thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which
 occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
 extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never
 so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in
",Holmes
7," But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and
 in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want
 to be funny. He got rather personal.
 
 “Work’us,” said Noah, “how’s your mother?”
 
 “She’s dead,” replied Oliver; “don’t you say anything about her to me!”
 
 Oliver’s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there
 was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole
 thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.
 Under this impression he returned to the charge.
 
 “What did she die of, Work’us?” said Noah.
 
 “Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,” replied Oliver:
 more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. “I think I
 know what it must be to die of that!”
 
 “Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work’us,” said Noah, as a tear
 rolled down Oliver’s cheek. “What’s set you a snivelling now?”
 
 “Not _you_,” replied Oliver, sharply. “There; that’s enough. Don’t say
 anything more to me about her; you’d better not!”
 
 “Better not!” exclaimed Noah. “Well! Better not! Work’us, don’t be
 impudent. _Your_ mother, too! She was a nice ’un she was. Oh, Lor!” And
 here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his
 small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the
 occasion.
 
 “Yer know, Work’us,” continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver’s silence,
 and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most
 annoying: “Yer know, Work’us, it can’t be helped now; and of course yer
 couldn’t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I’m sure we all
 are, and pity yer very much. But yer must know, Work’us, yer mother was
 a regular right-down bad ’un.”
 
 “What did you say?” inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.
 
 “A regular right-down bad ’un, Work’us,” replied Noah, coolly. “And
 it’s a great deal better, Work’us, that she died when she did, or else
 she’d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung;
 which is more likely than either, isn’t it?”
 
 Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table;
 seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till
 his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into
 one heavy blow, felled him to the ground.
 
 A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected
 creature that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused
 at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.
 His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid;
 his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly
 tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an
 energy he had never known before.
 
 “He’ll murder me!” blubbered Noah. “Charlotte! missis! Here’s the new
 boy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver’s gone mad! Char—lotte!”
 
 Noah’s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a
 louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen
 by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was
 quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human
 life, to come further down.
 
 “Oh, you little wretch!” screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her
 utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man
 in particularly good training. “Oh, you little un-grate-ful,
 mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!” And between every syllable, Charlotte
 gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream,
 for the benefit of society.
 
 Charlotte’s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not
 be effectual in calming Oliver’s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into
 the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she
 scratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of
 affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.
 
 This was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all
 wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,
 struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and
 there locked him up. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a
 chair, and burst into tears.
 
 “Bless her, she’s going off!” said Charlotte. “A glass of water, Noah,
 dear. Make haste!”
 
 “Oh! Charlotte,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she could,
 through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which
 Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. “Oh! Charlotte, what a
 mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!”
 
 “Ah! mercy indeed, ma’am,” was the reply. I only hope this’ll teach
 master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born
 to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He was
 all but killed, ma’am, when I come in.”
 
 “Poor fellow!” said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the
 charity-boy.
 
 Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level
 with the crown of Oliver’s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his
 wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed
 some affecting tears and sniffs.
 
 “What’s to be done!” exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. “Your master’s not at
 home; there’s not a man in the house, and he’ll kick that door down in
 ten minutes.” Oliver’s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in
 question, rendered this occurance highly probable.
 
 “Dear, dear! I don’t know, ma’am,” said Charlotte, “unless we send for
 the police-officers.”
 
 “Or the millingtary,” suggested Mr. Claypole.
 
 “No, no,” said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver’s old
 friend. “Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,
 and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold
 a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It’ll keep the swelling
 down.”
 
 Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed;
 and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a
 charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his
 head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER VII.
 OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY
 
 
 Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused
 not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested
 here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an
 imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and
 presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that
 even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of
 times, started back in astonishment.
 
 “Why, what’s the matter with the boy!” said the old pauper.
 
 “Mr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!” cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in
 tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.
 Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much
 that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,—which is a very
 curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle,
 acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a
 momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of
 personal dignity.
 
 “Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!” said Noah: “Oliver, sir,—Oliver has—”
 
 “What? What?” interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his
 metallic eyes. “Not run away; he hasn’t run away, has he, Noah?”
 
 “No, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he’s turned wicious,” replied
 Noah. “He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder
 Charlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony,
 please, sir!” And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an
 extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to
 understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist,
 he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was
 at that moment suffering the acutest torture.
 
 When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed
 Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his
 dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a
 gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in
 his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to
 attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman
 aforesaid.
 
 The gentleman’s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked
 three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young
 cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with
 something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so
 designated, an involuntary process?
 
 “It’s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,” replied Mr. Bumble, “who
 has been nearly murdered—all but murdered, sir,—by young Twist.”
 
 “By Jove!” exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping
 short. “I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,
 that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!”
 
 “He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,” said
 Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.
 
 “And his missis,” interposed Mr. Claypole.
 
 “And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?” added Mr. Bumble.
 
 “No! he’s out, or he would have murdered him,” replied Noah. “He said
 he wanted to.”
 
 “Ah! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?” inquired the gentleman in the
 white waistcoat.
 
 “Yes, sir,” replied Noah. “And please, sir, missis wants to know
 whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog
 him—’cause master’s out.”
 
 “Certainly, my boy; certainly,” said the gentleman in the white
 waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah’s head, which was about
 three inches higher than his own. “You’re a good boy—a very good boy.
 Here’s a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry’s with your
 cane, and see what’s best to be done. Don’t spare him, Bumble.”
 
 “No, I will not, sir,” replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane
 having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner’s satisfaction, Mr.
 Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the
 undertaker’s shop.
 
 Here the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had
 not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished
 vigour, at the cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by
 Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr.
 Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. With this
 view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then,
 applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:
 
 “Oliver!”
 
 “Come; you let me out!” replied Oliver, from the inside.
 
 “Do you know this here voice, Oliver?” said Mr. Bumble.
 
 “Yes,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Ain’t you afraid of it, sir? Ain’t you a-trembling while I speak,
 sir?” said Mr. Bumble.
 
 “No!” replied Oliver, boldly.
 
 An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was
 in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He
 stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and
 looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute
 astonishment.
 
 “Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,” said Mrs. Sowerberry.
 
 “No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.”
 
 “It’s not Madness, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of
 deep meditation. “It’s Meat.”
 
 “What?” exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.
 
 “Meat, ma’am, meat,” replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. “You’ve
 over-fed him, ma’am. You’ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him,
 ma’am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs.
 Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have
 paupers to do with soul or spirit? It’s quite enough that we let ’em
 have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma’am, this would
 never have happened.”
 
 “Dear, dear!” ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to
 the kitchen ceiling: “this comes of being liberal!”
 
 The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse
 bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else
 would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in
 her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble’s heavy accusation. Of
 which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or
 deed.
 
 “Ah!” said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth
 again; “the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to
 leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he’s a little starved
 down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the
 apprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs.
 Sowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his
 made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed
 any well-disposed woman, weeks before.”
 
 At this point of Mr. Bumble’s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to
 know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced
 kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.
 Sowerberry returned at this juncture. Oliver’s offence having been
 explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best
 calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a
 twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.
 
 Oliver’s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face
 was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.
 The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled
 out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite
 undismayed.
 
 “Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain’t you?” said Sowerberry; giving
 Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.
 
 “He called my mother names,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?” said Mrs.
 Sowerberry. “She deserved what he said, and worse.”
 
 “She didn’t” said Oliver.
 
 “She did,” said Mrs. Sowerberry.
 
 “It’s a lie!” said Oliver.
 
 Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.
 
 This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had
 hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be
 quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been,
 according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a
 brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of
 a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital
 within the limits of this chapter. To do him justice, he was, as far as
 his power went—it was not very extensive—kindly disposed towards the
 boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because
 his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no
 resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.
 Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble’s subsequent application of
 the parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was
 shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of
 bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks
 outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his
 mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of
 Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.
 
 It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the
 gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings
 which the day’s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a
 mere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he
 had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in
 his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they
 had roasted him alive. But now, when there were none to see or hear
 him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his
 hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few
 so young may ever have cause to pour out before him!
 
 For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The
 candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having
 gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the
 fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.
 
 It was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy’s eyes, farther
 from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind;
 and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked
 sepulchral and death-like, from being so still. He softly reclosed the
 door. Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie
 up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat
 himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.
 
 With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the
 shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look
 around—one moment’s pause of hesitation—he had closed it behind him,
 and was in the open street.
 
 He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.
 
 He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up
 the hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the
 fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the
 road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.
 
 Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside
 Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.
 His way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly
 when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back.
 He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by
 doing so. Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of
 his being seen; so he walked on.
 
 He reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring
 at that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child
 was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale
 face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver
 felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself,
 he had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and
 starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.
 
 “Hush, Dick!” said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his
 thin arm between the rails to greet him. “Is any one up?”
 
 “Nobody but me,” replied the child.
 
 “You musn’t say you saw me, Dick,” said Oliver. “I am running away.
 They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some
 long way off. I don’t know where. How pale you are!”
 
 “I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,” replied the child with a
 faint smile. “I am very glad to see you, dear; but don’t stop, don’t
 stop!”
 
 “Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b’ye to you,” replied Oliver. “I shall
 see you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!”
 
 “I hope so,” replied the child. “After I am dead, but not before. I
 know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of
 Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.
 Kiss me,” said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his
 little arms round Oliver’s neck. “Good-b’ye, dear! God bless you!”
 
 The blessing was from a young child’s lips, but it was the first that
 Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles
 and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never
 once forgot it.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER VIII.
 OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF
 YOUNG GENTLEMAN
 
 
 Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more
 gained the high-road. It was eight o’clock now. Though he was nearly
 five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by
 turns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then
 he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think,
 for the first time, where he had better go and try to live.
 
 The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an
 intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The
 name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy’s mind.
 
 London!—that great place!—nobody—not even Mr. Bumble—could ever find
 him there! He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say
 that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of
 living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country
 parts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who
 must die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things
 passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked
 forward.
 
 He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four
 miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could
 hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced
 itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his
 means of getting there. He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and
 two pairs of stockings, in his bundle. He had a penny too—a gift of
 Sowerberry’s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more
 than ordinarily well—in his pocket. “A clean shirt,” thought Oliver,
 “is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings;
 and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles’ walk
 in winter time.” But Oliver’s thoughts, like those of most other
 people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his
 difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of
 surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular
 purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and
 trudged on.
 
 Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing
 but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he
 begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side. When the night came, he
 turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined
 to lie there, till morning. He felt frightened at first, for the wind
 moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and
 more alone than he had ever felt before. Being very tired with his
 walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.
 
 He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that
 he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very
 first village through which he passed. He had walked no more than
 twelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his
 legs so weak that they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in
 the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey
 next morning he could hardly crawl along.
 
 He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and
 then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took
 any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the
 top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a
 halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way,
 but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When
 the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets
 again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn’t deserve
 anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust
 behind.
 
 In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all
 persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to
 jail. This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of
 those villages with all possible expedition. In others, he would stand
 about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a
 proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady’s ordering one of
 the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of
 the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he
 begged at a farmer’s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the
 dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about
 the beadle—which brought Oliver’s heart into his mouth,—very often the
 only thing he had there, for many hours together.
 
 In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a
 benevolent old lady, Oliver’s troubles would have been shortened by the
 very same process which had put an end to his mother’s; in other words,
 he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king’s highway. But
 the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady,
 who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part
 of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little
 she could afford—and more—with such kind and gentle words, and such
 tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver’s
 soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.
 
 Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver
 limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were
 closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business
 of the day. The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the
 light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation,
 as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.
 
 By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up;
 and people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver
 for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried
 by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he
 came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.
 
 He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great
 number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern,
 large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed
 through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with
 ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and
 determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by
 observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes
 before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the
 opposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at first; but the
 boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that
 Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon this, the
 boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,
 
 “Hullo, my covey! What’s the row?”
 
 The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his
 own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even
 seen. He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as
 dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the
 airs and manners of a man. He was short of his age: with rather
 bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of
 his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment—and
 would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of
 every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it
 back to its old place again. He wore a man’s coat, which reached nearly
 to his heels. He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get
 his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of
 thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he
 kept them. He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young
 gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the
 bluchers.
 
 “Hullo, my covey! What’s the row?” said this strange young gentleman to
 Oliver.
 
 “I am very hungry and tired,” replied Oliver: the tears standing in his
 eyes as he spoke. “I have walked a long way. I have been walking these
 seven days.”
 
 “Walking for sivin days!” said the young gentleman. “Oh, I see. Beak’s
 order, eh? But,” he added, noticing Oliver’s look of surprise, “I
 suppose you don’t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.”
 
 Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird’s mouth
 described by the term in question.
 
 “My eyes, how green!” exclaimed the young gentleman. “Why, a beak’s a
 madgst’rate; and when you walk by a beak’s order, it’s not straight
 forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. Was you
 never on the mill?”
 
 “What mill?” inquired Oliver.
 
 “What mill! Why, _the_ mill—the mill as takes up so little room that
 it’ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind’s
 low with people, than when it’s high; acos then they can’t get workmen.
 But come,” said the young gentleman; “you want grub, and you shall have
 it. I’m at low-water-mark myself—only one bob and a magpie; but, as far
 as it goes, I’ll fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There!
 Now then! “Morrice!”
 
 Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent
 chandler’s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham
 and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, “a fourpenny
 bran!” the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the
 ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a
 portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under
 his arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led
 the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer
 was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver,
 falling to, at his new friend’s bidding, made a long and hearty meal,
 during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time
 with great attention.
 
 “Going to London?” said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length
 concluded.
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Got any lodgings?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “Money?”
 
 “No.”
 
 The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as
 the big coat-sleeves would let them go.
 
 “Do you live in London?” inquired Oliver.
 
 “Yes. I do, when I’m at home,” replied the boy. “I suppose you want
 some place to sleep in to-night, don’t you?”
 
 “I do, indeed,” answered Oliver. “I have not slept under a roof since I
 left the country.”
 
 “Don’t fret your eyelids on that score,” said the young gentleman.
 “I’ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a ’spectable old
 gentleman as lives there, wot’ll give you lodgings for nothink, and
 never ask for the change—that is, if any genelman he knows interduces
 you. And don’t he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means.
 Certainly not!”
 
 The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments
 of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did
 so.
 
 This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;
 especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the
 old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a
 comfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly
 and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his
 friend’s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and
 protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.
 
 Mr. Dawkin’s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the
 comforts which his patron’s interest obtained for those whom he took
 under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute
 mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate
 friends he was better known by the sobriquet of “The Artful Dodger,”
 Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the
 moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon
 him. Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good
 opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found
 the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to
 decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.
 
 As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it
 was nearly eleven o’clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.
 They crossed from the Angel into St. John’s Road; struck down the small
 street which terminates at Sadler’s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth
 Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the
 workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of
 Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into
 Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace,
 directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.
 
 Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of
 his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either
 side of the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place
 he had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air
 was impregnated with filthy odours.
 
 There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade
 appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were
 crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The
 sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the
 place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish
 were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here
 and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of
 houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth;
 and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were
 cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed
 or harmless errands.
 
 Oliver was just considering whether he hadn’t better run away, when
 they reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor, catching him by the
 arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him
 into the passage, closed it behind them.
 
 “Now, then!” cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the
 Dodger.
 
 “Plummy and slam!” was the reply.
 
 This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the
 light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the
 passage; and a man’s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the
 old kitchen staircase had been broken away.
 
 “There’s two on you,” said the man, thrusting the candle farther out,
 and shielding his eyes with his hand. “Who’s the t’other one?”
 
 “A new pal,” replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.
 
 “Where did he come from?”
 
 “Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?”
 
 “Yes, he’s a sortin’ the wipes. Up with you!” The candle was drawn
 back, and the face disappeared.
 
 Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly
 grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and
 broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition
 that showed he was well acquainted with them.
 
 He threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.
 
 The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and
 dirt. There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle,
 stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and
 butter, and a plate. In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which
 was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking;
 and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very
 old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was
 obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy
 flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his
 attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which a
 great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. Several rough beds
 made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round
 the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking
 long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.
 These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to
 the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew
 himself, toasting-fork in hand.
 
 “This is him, Fagin,” said Jack Dawkins; “my friend Oliver Twist.”
 
 The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the
 hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.
 Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook
 both his hands very hard—especially the one in which he held his little
 bundle. One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for
 him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in
 order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of
 emptying them, himself, when he went to bed. These civilities would
 probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the
 Jew’s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate
 youths who offered them.
 
 “We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,” said the Jew. “Dodger,
 take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah,
 you’re a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a
 good many of ’em, ain’t there? We’ve just looked ’em out, ready for the
 wash; that’s all, Oliver; that’s all. Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from
 all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of
 which they went to supper.
 
 Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot
 gin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because
 another gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired.
 Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the
 sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER IX.
 CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN,
 AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS
 
 
 It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.
 There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling
 some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to
 himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would
 stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below:
 and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and
 stirring again, as before.
 
 Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly
 awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you
 dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half
 conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in
 five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in
 perfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of
 what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its
 mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space,
 when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.
 
 Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his
 half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of
 the spoon grating against the saucepan’s sides: and yet the self-same
 senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with
 almost everybody he had ever known.
 
 When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.
 Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he
 did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at
 Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all
 appearances asleep.
 
 After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the
 door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,
 from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on
 the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.
 Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a
 magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.
 
 “Aha!” said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every
 feature with a hideous grin. “Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the
 last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old
 Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn’t have loosened the knot, or kept
 the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!”
 
 With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew
 once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a
 dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed
 with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other
 articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly
 workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.
 
 Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that
 it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute
 inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading
 it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put
 it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair,
 muttered:
 
 “What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead
 men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it’s a fine thing for the
 trade! Five of ’em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or
 turn white-livered!”
 
 As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been
 staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver’s face; the boy’s eyes were
 fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only
 for an instant—for the briefest space of time that can possibly be
 conceived—it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.
 
 He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on
 a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled
 very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the
 knife quivered in the air.
 
 “What’s that?” said the Jew. “What do you watch me for? Why are you
 awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick—quick! for your life.
 
 “I wasn’t able to sleep any longer, sir,” replied Oliver, meekly. “I am
 very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.”
 
 “You were not awake an hour ago?” said the Jew, scowling fiercely on
 the boy.
 
 “No! No, indeed!” replied Oliver.
 
 “Are you sure?” cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:
 and a threatening attitude.
 
 “Upon my word I was not, sir,” replied Oliver, earnestly. “I was not,
 indeed, sir.”
 
 “Tush, tush, my dear!” said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner,
 and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to
 induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. “Of course I
 know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You’re a brave boy.
 Ha! ha! you’re a brave boy, Oliver.” The Jew rubbed his hands with a
 chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.
 
 “Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?” said the Jew, laying
 his hand upon it after a short pause.
 
 “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Ah!” said the Jew, turning rather pale. “They—they’re mine, Oliver; my
 little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call
 me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that’s all.”
 
 Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in
 such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps
 his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of
 money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he
 might get up.
 
 “Certainly, my dear, certainly,” replied the old gentleman. “Stay.
 There’s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here;
 and I’ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.”
 
 Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to
 raise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.
 
 He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying
 the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew’s directions, when
 the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom
 Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally
 introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on
 the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought
 home in the crown of his hat.
 
 “Well,” said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself
 to the Dodger, “I hope you’ve been at work this morning, my dears?”
 
 “Hard,” replied the Dodger.
 
 “As nails,” added Charley Bates.
 
 “Good boys, good boys!” said the Jew. “What have you got, Dodger?”
 
 “A couple of pocket-books,” replied that young gentlman.
 
 “Lined?” inquired the Jew, with eagerness.
 
 “Pretty well,” replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one
 green, and the other red.
 
 “Not so heavy as they might be,” said the Jew, after looking at the
 insides carefully; “but very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman,
 ain’t he, Oliver?”
 
 “Very indeed, sir,” said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed
 uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to
 laugh at, in anything that had passed.
 
 “And what have you got, my dear?” said Fagin to Charley Bates.
 
 “Wipes,” replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four
 pocket-handkerchiefs.
 
 “Well,” said the Jew, inspecting them closely; “they’re very good ones,
 very. You haven’t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall
 be picked out with a needle, and we’ll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall
 us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 “If you please, sir,” said Oliver.
 
 “You’d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley
 Bates, wouldn’t you, my dear?” said the Jew.
 
 “Very much, indeed, if you’ll teach me, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that
 he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was
 drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly
 terminated in his premature suffocation.
 
 “He is so jolly green!” said Charley when he recovered, as an apology
 to the company for his unpolite behaviour.
 
 The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver’s hair over his eyes,
 and said he’d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman,
 observing Oliver’s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking
 whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?
 This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies
 of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally
 wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very
 industrious.
 
 When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two
 boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in
 this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of
 his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat
 pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond
 pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his
 spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the
 room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen
",OliverTwist
8," 
 “I want him back.”
 
 “Then you shall have him back. You shall have everything you want, only
 go on getting better.” She turned her face away from me.
 
 “Have I begun?”
 
 She made no answer, and I knew it was because she could not at the
 moment command her voice.
 
 So I stayed quiet a little while. Then I began again to beg her to rid
 me of Lansdowne.
 
 “After all, he is independent of his profession,” she said at length
 thoughtfully, thinking of his feelings and how not to hurt them. “He
 married a rich woman.”
 
 “He would. And I am sure he has no children,” I answered.
 
 “Good heavens! How did you know? You are cleverer when you are ill than
 other people when they are well.”
 
 That is like Ella, too, she has an exaggerated and absurd opinion of my
 talent. Just because I write novels which are paid for beyond their
 deserts!
 
 I don’t know how she did it, I don’t know how she accomplished half of
 the magical wonderful things she did for my comfort all that sad time.
 But I was not even surprised, a few days later, when I really was better
 and sitting up in bed; propped up by pillows, I admit, but still
 actually sitting up; that Dr. Kennedy, tall and unaltered, with the same
 light in his eye, even the same dreadful country suit, lounged in and
 sat on the chair by my side. Ella went away when he came in, she always
 had an idea that patients like to see their doctors alone. She flirts
 with hers, I think. She is incurably flirtatious in her leisure hours.
 
 “You’ve had a bad time,” he said abruptly.
 
 “You didn’t try to make it any better,” I answered weakly.
 
 “Oh! I! I was dismissed. Your sister turned me out. She said I hadn’t
 recognised how ill you were. I told her she was quite right. I didn’t
 tell her how often you had refused to see me.”
 
 “Did you know how ill I was?”
 
 “I’m not sure.” He smiled, and so did I. “Were you so ill?”
 
 “I know now what Margaret Capel felt about Dr. Lansdowne.”
 
 “He is a very able fellow. And you’ve had Felton, Shorter, Lawson.”
 
 “Don’t remind me.”
 
 “Anyway you are getting better now.”
 
 “Am I? I am so hideously weak.”
 
 “Not beginning to write again yet! You see, I know all about you now.
 I’ve taken a course of your novels.”
 
 “Thinking all the time how much better Margaret Capel wrote?”
 
 “You haven’t forgotten Margaret, then?”
 
 “Have _you_?” He became quite grave and pale.
 
 “I! I shall never forget Margaret Capel.”
 
 Up till then he had been light and airy in manner, as if this visit and
 circumstance and poor me, who had been so near the Gates, were of little
 consequence.
 
 “Did you think how much worse I wrote than she did, that I was no
 stylist?”
 
 “Why do you say that?”
 
 I was glad to see him and wished to keep him by my side. I thought what
 I was going to tell him would secure my object.
 
 “She told me so herself” I shot at him, and watched to see how he would
 take it. “The last time I saw you, the night the pleurisy started, she
 sat over there by the fireside. We talked together confidentially, she
 said she knew I would write her story, and was sorry because I had no
 style.” There was a flush on his forehead, he looked to where I said she
 sat.
 
 “What else did she say?” He did not seem to doubt me or to be surprised.
 
 “You believe I saw her, that it was not a dream?”
 
 “There is an unexplored borderland between dreams and reality. Fever
 often bridges it. Your temperature was probably high. And I, and you,
 were so full of her. Go on. Tell me what she wore.”
 
 “She was dressed in grey, a white fichu over her shoulders.”
 
 “And a pink rose.”
 
 “Her hair....”
 
 “Was snooded with a blue ribbon.” He finished my sentences excitedly.
 
 “No. It was hanging in plaits.”
 
 “Oh, no! Not when she wore the grey dress.” He had risen and was
 standing by the bed now, he seemed anxious, almost imploring. “Think
 again. Shut your eyes and think again. Surely she had the blue ribbon.”
 
 I shut my eyes as he bade me. Then opened them and stared at him.
 
 “But how did you know?”
 
 “Go on. There was a blue ribbon in her hair?”
 
 “The first time I saw her. The next time her hair was hanging down her
 back, two great plaits of fair hair, and she had on a blue
 dressing-gown.”
 
 “With a white collar like a fine handkerchief, showing her slender
 throat.”
 
 “How well you knew her clothes.”
 
 “There was a sense of fitness about her, an exquisite sense of fitness.
 She would not have worn her hair down with that grey dress.”
 
 “You know I really did see her.”
 
 “Of course. Go on. Tell me exactly what she said, word for word.”
 
 “About my bad style.”
 
 “About your good sense of comradeship with her.”
 
 “She said I would write the story. Hers and Gabriel Stanton’s.”
 
 I told him all she had said, word for word as well as I could remember
 it, keeping my eyes shut, speaking slowly, remembering well.
 
 “She told me of the letters and diary, the notes, chapter headings, all
 she had prepared....”
 
 I turned my head away, sank down amongst the pillows, and turned my head
 away. I didn’t want him to see my disappointment, to know that I had
 found nothing. Now I recognised my weakness, that I was spent with
 feverish nights and pain.
 
 “I can’t talk any more.” He put his hand upon my pulse.
 
 “Your pulse is quite strong.”
 
 “I am not,” I said shortly. I wished Ella would come back.
 
 “You looked for them?” I did not answer.
 
 “I am so sorry. Blundering fool that I am. You looked, and looked ...
 that is why you kept me at arm’s length, would not see me, wanted to be
 alone. You were searching. Why didn’t I think of it before? But how did
 I know she would come to you, confide in you?”
 
 He was talking to himself now, seemed to forget me and my grave illness.
 “I might have thought of it though. From the first I pictured you two
 together. I have them. I took them ... didn’t you guess?” I forgot the
 extreme weakness of which I had complained, and caught hold of his coat
 sleeve, a little breathless.
 
 “You took them ... stole them?”
 
 “Yes. If you put it that way. Who had a better right? I knew everything.
 Her father, her people, nothing, or very little. And she had not wished
 them to know.”
 
 “She was going to write the story, whatever it was; to publish it.”
 
 “No! not immediately, not until long afterwards, not until it would hurt
 no one. They were in the writing-table drawer, the letters, in an
 elastic band. She was not tidy as a rule with papers, but these were
 tidy. The diary was bound in soft grey leather, and there were a few
 rough notes; loose, on MS. paper. You know all that happened there; the
 excitement was intense. How could I bear her papers, his letters, her
 notes to fall into strange hands. I was doing what she would wish, I
 knew I was carrying out her wishes. The day she ... she died I gathered
 them all together, slipped them into my greatcoat pocket; the car was at
 the door. I hurried away as if I had been a thief, the thief you are
 thinking me.”
 
 “Got home quickly, gloated over them all that evening.”
 
 “I swear to you, I swear to you I have never opened the packet. I have
 never looked at them. I made one parcel of them all, of the letters,
 diary, notes; wrapped them all together in brown paper, tied it up with
 string, sealed it.
 
 “You’ve got it still!” I was in high excitement, all my pulses
 throbbing, face flushed, hands hot, breathless.
 
 “In the safe at my bank. I took it there the next morning.”
 
 “You are going to give me the packet?”
 
 “But of course.” He seemed suddenly to recollect that I was an invalid,
 that he was supposed to be my doctor. “I say, all this excitement is
 very bad for you. Your sister will turn me out again. Can’t you lie
 down, get quiet,—you’ve jumped from 90 to 112.” His hand was on my pulse
 again. I knew I was going beyond my tether and cursed my weakness.
 
 “You won’t change your mind!” I was lying on my back now, quite still,
 trying to quiet myself as he had told me. “Promise!”
 
 “I’ll get the packet in the morning, as soon as the bank is open, and
 come straight on here with it. You must find some place to put it. Where
 you can see it, know it’s there all the time. But you mustn’t open it,
 you must get stronger first. You know you can’t use it yet.”
 
 “Yes, I can.”
 
 “It would be very wrong. You wouldn’t do it well.”
 
 “I’m sick of being ordered about.” But I could barely move and breathing
 was becoming difficult to me, I had a sense of faintness, suffocation,
 the room grew dark. He opened the door and called nurse. Ella came in
 with her. I was conscious of that.
 
 “What does she have when she is like this? Smelling salts, brandy?”
 Nurse began to fan me; my cheeks were very flushed.
 
 Ella opened the windows, wide, quietly; the scent of the gorse came in.
 I did not want to speak, only to be able to breathe.
 
 Nurse telegraphed him an enquiring glance. Strychnine? her dumb lips
 asked. He shook his head.
 
 “Oxygen. Have you got a cylinder of oxygen in the house?” He took the
 pillows from under my head.
 
 I don’t know what they tried or left untried. Whenever I opened my eyes
 I sought for Ella’s. I knew she would not let them do anything to me
 that might bring the pain back. I was only over-tired. I managed to say
 so presently. When I was really better and Dr. Kennedy gone, Ella said a
 bitter word or two about him. Nurse too thought she should have been
 called sooner. A good nurse, but dissatisfied up to now with all my
 treatment, with my change of doctors, with my resistance to authority,
 and Ella’s interference.
 
 “Ella.” She had been sitting by the fire but came over to me at once.
 
 “What is it? I am only going to stop a minute. Then I shall leave you to
 nurse. That man stopped too long, over-excited you. We mustn’t have him
 again, he doesn’t understand you.”
 
 “Yes he does; perfectly.” My voice may have been faint, but I succeeded
 in making it urgent. “Ella, I want to see him again in the morning,
 nothing must prevent it, nothing. Don’t talk against him, I want him.”
 
 “Then you shall have him,” she decided promptly. Notwithstanding my
 terrible weakness and want of breath I smiled at her.
 
 “I suppose you’ve fallen in love with him,” she said. Love and
 love-making were half her life, the game she found most fascinating.
 They were nothing to do with mine.
 
 “See that he comes. That’s all. However ill I am, whether I’m ill or
 not, he is to come.”
 
 “You noticed his clothes?”
 
 “Oh, yes!”
 
 Nurse I suppose thought we had both gone mad. But she came over to me
 and lifted me into a more comfortable position, fanned me again, and
 when the fanning had done its work brought _eau de Cologne_ and water
 and sponged my face, my hot hands. She told Ella that she ought to go,
 that I ought to be alone, that I should have a bad night if I were not
 left to myself. Ella only wanted to do what was best for me.
 
 “I am sure you are right, nurse. I shan’t come in again. Sleep well.”
 
 “You are sure?”
 
 “Quite sure that Dr. Kennedy shall come in the morning, if I have to
 drag him here. It’s a pity you will have an executioner instead of a
 doctor; he seems to do you harm every time he comes. You had your worst
 attack when he was here before. Good-night. I do wish you had better
 taste.”
 
 She kept her light tone up to the last, although I saw she was pale with
 anxiety and sympathy. Days ago she had asked me if the nurses were good
 and kind to me, and if I liked them, and had received my assurance that
 this one at least was the best I had ever had, clever and untiring. If
 only she had not been so sure of herself and that she knew better than I
 did what was good for me, I should have thought her perfect. She had a
 delightful voice, never touched me unnecessarily, nor brushed against
 the bed. But she was younger than I, and I resented her authority. We
 were often in antagonism, for I was a bad invalid, in resistance all the
 time. I had not learnt yet how to be ill! The lesson was taught me
 slowly, cruelly, but I recognised Benham’s quality long before I gave in
 to her. Now I was glad that Ella should go, that nurse should minister
 to me alone. I wanted the night to come ... and go. But my exhaustion
 was so complete that I had forgotten why.
 
 
 
 
                               CHAPTER III
 
 
 I seem to be a long time coming to the story, but my own will intervene,
 my own dreadful tale of dependence and deepening illness. Benham was my
 day nurse. At ten o’clock that night she left me, considerably better
 and calm. Then Lakeby came on duty, a very inferior person who always
 talked to me as if I were a child to be humoured: “Now then be a dear
 good girl and drink it up” represents her fairly well. Then she would
 yawn in my face without apology or attempt to hide her fatigue or
 boredom. Nepenthe and I were no longer friends. It gave me no ease, yet
 I drank it to save argument. Lakeby took away the glass and then lay
 down at the foot of the bed. I thought again, as I had thought so many
 times, that no one ever sleeps so soundly as a night nurse. I could
 indulge my restlessness without any fear of disturbing her. Tomorrow’s
 promised excitement would not let me sleep. Their letters, the very
 letters they had written to each other! I did not care so much about the
 diary. I had once kept a diary myself and knew how one leaves out all
 the essentials. I suppose I drowsed a little. Nepenthe was no longer my
 friend, but we were not enemies, only disappointed lovers, without
 reliance on each other. As I approached the borderland I wished Margaret
 were in her easy-chair by the fireside. I did not care whether she was
 in her grey, or with her plaits and peignoir. I watched for her in vain.
 I knew she would not come whilst nurse snored on the sofa. Ella would
 have to get rid of the nurse from my room. Surely now that I was better
 I could sleep alone, a bell could be fixed up. Two nurses were
 unnecessary, extravagant. I woke to cough and was conscious of a strange
 sensation. I turned on the light by my side, but then only roused the
 nurse (she had slept all day) with difficulty. I knew what had happened,
 although this was the first time it had happened to me, and wanted to
 reassure her or myself. Also to tell her what to do.
 
 “Get ice. Call Benham; ring up the doctor.” This was my first
 hæmorrhage, very profuse and alarming, and Lakeby although she was
 inferior was not inefficient. When she was really roused she carried out
 my instructions to the letter. Once Benham was in the room I knew at
 least I was in good hands. I begged them not to rouse the house more
 than necessary, not to call Ella.
 
 “Don’t you speak a word. Lie quite still. We know exactly what is to be
 done. Mrs. Lovegrove won’t be disturbed, nor anybody if you will only do
 what you are told.”
 
 Benham’s voice changed in an emergency; it was always a beautiful voice
 if a little hard; now it was gentle, soft, and her whole manner altered.
 She had me and the situation completely under her control, and that, of
 course, was what she always wanted. That night she was the perfect
 nurse. Lakeby obeyed her as if she had been a probationer. I often
 wonder I am not more grateful to Benham, failed to become quickly
 attached to her. I don’t think perhaps that mine is a grateful nature,
 but I surely recognised already tonight, in this bad hour, her complete
 and wonderful competence. I was in high fever, very agitated, yet
 striving to keep command of my nerves.
 
 “It looks bad, you know, but it is not really serious, it is only a
 symptom, not a disease. All you have to do is to keep very quiet. The
 doctor will soon be here.”
 
 “I’m not frightened.”
 
 “Hush! I’m sure you are not.”
 
 A hot bottle to my feet, little lumps of ice to suck; loose warm
 covering adjusted round me quickly, the blinds pulled up, and the window
 opened, there was nothing of which she did not think. And the little she
 said was all in the right key, not making light of my trouble, but
 explaining, minimizing it, helping me to calm my disordered nerves.
 
 “I would give you a morphia injection only that Dr. Kennedy will be here
 any moment now.”
 
 I don’t think it could have been long after that before he was in the
 room. In the meantime I was hating the sight of my own blood and kept
 begging the nurses or signing to them to remove basins and stained
 clothes.
 
 Nurse Benham told him very quietly what had happened. He was looking at
 me and said encouragingly:
 
 “You will soon be all right.”
 
 I was still coughing up blood and did not feel reassured. I heard him
 ask for hot water. Nurse and he were at the chest of drawers, whispering
 over something that might be cooking operations. Then nurse came back to
 the bed.
 
 “Dr. Kennedy is going to give you a morphia injection that will stop the
 hæmorrhage at once.”
 
 She rolled up the sleeve of my nightgown, and I saw he was beside her.
 
 “How much?” I got out.
 
 “A quarter of a grain,” he answered quietly. “You’ll find it will be
 quite enough. If not, you can have another.”
 
 I resented the prick of the needle, and that having hurt me he should
 rub the place with his finger, making it worse, I thought. I got
 reconciled to it however, and his presence there, very soon. He was
 still in tweeds and they smelt of gorse or peat, of something pleasant.
 
 “Getting better?”
 
 There was no doubt the hæmorrhage was coming to an end, and I was no
 longer shivering and apprehensive. He felt my pulse and said it was
 “very good.”
 
 “The usual cackle!” I was able to smile.
 
 “I shouldn’t talk if I were you.” He smiled too. “You will be quite
 comfortable in half an hour.”
 
 “I am not uncomfortable now.” He laughed, a low and pleasant laugh.
 
 “She is wonderful, isn’t she?” he said to Benham. Benham was clearing
 away every evidence of what had occurred, and I felt how competent they
 both were, and again that I was in good hands. I was glad Ella was
 asleep and knew nothing of what was happening.
 
 Dr. Kennedy was over at the chest of drawers again.
 
 “I’ll leave you another dose,” he said, and they talked together. Then
 he came to say “good-bye” to me.
 
 “Can’t I sleep by myself? I hate any one in the room with me.” I wanted
 to add, “it spoils my dreams,” but am not sure if I actually said the
 words.
 
 “You’ll find you will be all right, as right as rain. Nurse will fix you
 up. All you have to do is to go to sleep. If not she will give you
 another dose. I’ve left it measured out. You are not afraid, are you?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “The good dreams will come. I am willing them to you.” I found it
 difficult to concentrate.
 
 “What did you promise me before?”
 
 “Nothing I shan’t perform. Good-night....”
 
 He went away quickly.
 
 I was wider awake than I wished to be, and soon a desire for action was
 racing in my disordered mind. I thought the hæmorrhage meant death, and
 I had left so many things undone. I could not recollect the provisions
 of my will, and felt sure it was unjust. I could have been kinder to so
 many people, the dead as well as the living. It is so easy to say sharp,
 clever things; so difficult to unsay them. I remembered one particular
 act of unkindness ... even now I cannot bear to recall it. Alas! it was
 to one now dead. And Ella, Ella did not know I returned her love, full
 measure, pressed down, brimming over. Once, very many years ago, when
 she was in need and I supposed to be rich, she asked me to lend her five
 hundred pounds. Because I hadn’t it, and was too proud to say so, I was
 ruder to her than seems possible now, asking why I should work to supply
 her extravagances. But she was never extravagant, except in giving. Oh,
 God! That five hundred pounds! How many times I have thought of it. What
 would I not give not to have said no, to have humbled my pride, admitted
 I could not put my hands on so large a sum? Now she lavishes her all on
 me. And if it were true that I was dying, already I was not sure, she
 would be lonely in her world. Without each other we were always lonely.
 Love of sisters is unlike all other love. We had slept in each other’s
 bed from babyhood onward, told each other all our little secrets, been
 banded together against nurses and governesses, maintained our intimacy
 in changed and changing circumstances, through long and varied years.
 Ella would be lonely when I was dead. A hot tear or two oozed through my
 closed lids when I thought of Ella’s loneliness without me. I wiped
 those tears away feebly with the sheet. The room was very strange and
 quiet, not quite steady when I opened my eyes. So I shut them. The
 morphia was beginning to act.
 
 “Why are you crying?”
 
 “How could you see me over there?” But I no longer wanted to cry and I
 had forgotten Ella. I opened my eyes when she spoke. The fire was low
 and the room dark, quite steady and ordinary. Margaret was sitting by
 the fireside, and I saw her more clearly than I had ever seen her
 before, a pale, clever, whimsical face, thin-featured and mobile, with
 grey eyes.
 
 “It is absurd to cry,” she said. “When I finished crying there were no
 tears in the world to shed. All the grief, all the unhappiness died with
 me.”
 
 “Why were you so unhappy?” I asked.
 
 “Because I was a fool,” she answered. “When you tell my story you must
 do it as sympathetically as possible, make people sorry for me. But that
 is the truth. I was unhappy because I was a fool.”
 
 “You still think I shall write your story. The critics will be
 pleased....” I began to remember all they would say, the flattering
 notices.
 
 “Why were you crying?” she persisted. “Are you a fool too?”
 
 “No. Only on Ella’s account I don’t want to die.”
 
 “You need not fear. Is Ella some one who loves you? If so she will keep
 you here. Gabriel did not love me enough. If some one needs us
 desperately and loves us completely, we don’t die.”
 
 “Did no one love you like that?”
 
 “I died,” she answered concisely, and then gazed into the fire.
 
 My limbs relaxed, I felt drowsy and convinced of great talent. I had
 never done myself justice, but with this story of Margaret Capel’s I
 should come into my own. I wrote the opening sentence, a splendid
 sentence, arresting. And then I went on easily. I, who always wrote with
 infinite difficulty, slowly, and trying each phrase over again, weighing
 and appraising it, now found an amazing fluency come to me. I wrote and
 wrote.
 
 De Quincey has not spoken the last word on morphia dreams. It is only a
 pity he spoke so well that lesser writers are chary of giving their
 experiences. The next few days, as I heard afterwards, I lay between
 life and death, the temperature never below 102 and the hæmorrhage
 recurring. I only know that they were calm and happy days. Ella was
 there and we understood each other perfectly, without words. The nurses
 came and went, and when it was Benham I was glad and she knew my needs,
 when I was thirsty, or wanted this or that. But when Lakeby replaced her
 she would talk and say silly soothing things, shake up my pillows when I
 wanted to be left alone, touch the bed when she passed it, coax me to
",Twilight
9," and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of
 intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would
 look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other
 mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enrapt in the music at St.
 James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom
 he had set himself to hunt down.
 
 “You want to go home, no doubt, doctor,” he remarked, as we emerged.
 
 “Yes, it would be as well.”
 
 “And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This
 business at Coburg Square is serious.”
 
 “Why serious?”
 
 “A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to
 believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday
 rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”
 
 “At what time?”
 
 “Ten will be early enough.”
 
 “I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”
 
 “Very well. And, I say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so
 kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand,
 turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
 
 [Illustration: “ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS”]
 
 I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always
 oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock
 Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had
 seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not
 only what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the
 whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to
 my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary
 story of the red-headed copier of the “Encyclopædia” down to the visit
 to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted
 from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
 Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes
 that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a
 man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it
 up in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an
 explanation.
 
 It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way
 across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two
 hansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I
 heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found
 Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized
 as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long,
 thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable
 frock-coat.
 
 “Ha! our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket,
 and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think
 you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.
 Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”
 
 “We’re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,” said Jones, in his
 consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a
 chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”
 
 “I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”
 observed Mr. Merryweather, gloomily.
 
 “You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the
 police agent, loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he
 won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,
 but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to
 say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and
 the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official
 force.”
 
 “Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger,
 with deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the
 first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my
 rubber.”
 
 “I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for
 a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play
 will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be
 some £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish
 to lay your hands.”
 
 “John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,
 Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would
 rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a
 remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,
 and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as
 his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never
 know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one
 week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
 I’ve been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.”
 
 “I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve
 had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with
 you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,
 and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,
 Watson and I will follow in the second.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive,
 and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the
 afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
 until we emerged into Farringdon Street.
 
 “We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather
 is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought
 it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though
 an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He
 is as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his
 claws upon any one. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”
 
 We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found
 ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following
 the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage
 and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a
 small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was
 opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated
 at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a
 lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and
 so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was
 piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
 
 “You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked, as he held
 up the lantern and gazed about him.
 
 “Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the
 flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he
 remarked, looking up in surprise.
 
 “I must really ask you to be a little more quiet,” said Holmes,
 severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our
 expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down
 upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”
 
 The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very
 injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees
 upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to
 examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed
 to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in
 his pocket.
 
 “We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked; “for they can
 hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
 Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work
 the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,
 doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch
 of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman
 of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the
 more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in
 this cellar at present.”
 
 “It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several
 warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”
 
 “Your French gold?”
 
 “Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and
 borrowed, for that purpose, 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.
 It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the
 money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which
 I sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our
 reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a
 single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the
 subject.”
 
 “Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time
 that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters
 will come to a head. In the mean time, Mr. Merryweather, we must put
 the screen over that dark lantern.”
 
 “And sit in the dark?”
 
 “I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I
 thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber
 after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far
 that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must
 choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take
 them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
 I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind
 those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they
 fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”
 
 I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind
 which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his
 lantern, and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness
 as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained
 to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at
 a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of
 expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden
 gloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.
 
 “They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through
 the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I
 asked you, Jones?”
 
 “I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”
 
 “Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and
 wait.”
 
 What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an
 hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have
 almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and
 stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked
 up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I
 could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could
 distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the
 thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look
 over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught
 the glint of a light.
 
 At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it
 lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any
 warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white,
 almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area
 of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,
 protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it
 appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which
 marked a chink between the stones.
 
 Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing
 sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and
 left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a
 lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which
 looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the
 aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee
 rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the
 hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like
 himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
 
 “It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags.
 Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”
 
 Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.
 The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth
 as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a
 revolver, but Holmes’s hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and
 the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
 
 “It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes, blandly. “You have no chance at
 all.”
 
 “So I see,” the other answered, with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that
 my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”
 
 “There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.
 
 “Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must
 compliment you.”
 
 “And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and
 effective.”
 
 “You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at
 climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”
 
 “I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked
 our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not
 be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,
 when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”
 
 “All right,” said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you
 please, sir, march up-stairs, where we can get a cab to carry your
 highness to the police-station?”
 
 “That is better,” said John Clay, serenely. He made a sweeping bow to
 the three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
 
 “Really Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from
 the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.
 There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most
 complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
 that have ever come within my experience.”
 
 “I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.
 John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this
 matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am
 amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,
 and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 “You see, Watson,” he explained, in the early hours of the morning,
 as we sat over a glass of whiskey-and-soda in Baker Street, “it was
 perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this
 rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the
 copying of the ‘Encyclopædia,’ must be to get this not over-bright
 pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a
 curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to
 suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious
 mind by the color of his accomplice’s hair. The £4 a week was a lure
 which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for
 thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary
 office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together
 they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From
 the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages,
 it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the
 situation.”
 
 “But how could you guess what the motive was?”
 
 “Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere
 vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s
 business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which
 could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure
 as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What
 could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography,
 and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the
 end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious
 assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest
 and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the
 cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What
 could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was
 running a tunnel to some other building.
 
 “So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
 surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
 ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
 It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
 assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never
 set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His
 knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how
 worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of
 burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I
 walked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on
 our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you
 drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the
 chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”
 
 “And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I
 asked.
 
 “Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they
 cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words,
 that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they
 should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might
 be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it
 would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I
 expected them to come to-night.”
 
 “You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed, in unfeigned
 admiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”
 
 “It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel
 it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape
 from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do
 so.”
 
 “And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.
 
 He shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some
 little use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est
 tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sand.”
 
 
 
 
 Adventure III
 
 A CASE OF IDENTITY
 
 
 “My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side
 of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely
 stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would
 not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of
 existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over
 this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer
 things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings,
 the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through
 generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all
 fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale
 and unprofitable.”
 
 “And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come
 to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.
 We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits,
 and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor
 artistic.”
 
 “A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
 realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police
 report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the
 magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the
 vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it there is nothing so
 unnatural as the commonplace.”
 
 I smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand you thinking so,”
 I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper
 to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,
 you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But
 here”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it
 to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A
 husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but
 I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me.
 There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow,
 the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers
 could invent nothing more crude.”
 
 “Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,”
 said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This
 is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in
 clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was
 a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of
 was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by
 taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you
 will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the
 average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge
 that I have scored over you in your example.”
 
 He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the
 centre of the lid. Its splendor was in such contrast to his homely ways
 and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.
 
 “Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is
 a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance
 in the case of the Irene Adler papers.”
 
 “And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
 sparkled upon his finger.
 
 “It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which
 I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to
 you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little
 problems.”
 
 “And have you any on hand just now?” I asked, with interest.
 
 “Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.
 They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,
 I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is
 a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and
 effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are
 apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as
 a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate
 matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
 which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that
 I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this
 is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”
 
 He had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted
 blinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted London street.
 Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there
 stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large
 curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a
 coquettish Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under
 this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at
 our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her
 fingers fidgetted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as
 of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we
 heard the sharp clang of the bell.
 
 “I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his
 cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an
 _affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the
 matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may
 discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no
 longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we
 may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so
 much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to
 resolve our doubts.”
 
 As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered
 to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind
 his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny
 pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for
 which he was remarkable, and having closed the door, and bowed her into
 an arm-chair, he looked her over in the minute, and yet abstracted
 fashion which was peculiar to him.
 
 “Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little
 trying to do so much type-writing?”
 
 “I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters
 are without looking.” Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of
 his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and
 astonishment upon her broad, good-humored face. “You’ve heard about me,
 Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?”
 
 “Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.
 Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why
 should you come to consult me?”
 
 “I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose
 husband you found so easy when the police and every one had given him
 up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m
 not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides
 the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know
 what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”
 
 “Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock
 Holmes, with his finger-tips together, and his eyes to the ceiling.
 
 Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary
 Sutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it
 made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my
 father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not
 go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing, and kept on saying
 that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my
 things and came right away to you.”
 
 “Your father,” said Holmes, “your step-father, surely, since the name
 is different.”
 
 “Yes, my step-father. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,
 for he is only five years and two months older than myself.”
 
 “And your mother is alive?”
 
 “Oh yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,
 when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was
 nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the
 Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which
 mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank
 came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a
 traveller in wines. They got £4700 for the goodwill and interest, which
 wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.”
 
 I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and
 inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with
 the greatest concentration of attention.
 
 “Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”
 
 “Oh no, sir. It is quite separate, and was left me by my Uncle Ned
 in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4-1/2 per cent. Two
 thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the
 interest.”
 
 “You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large
 a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no
 doubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in every way. I believe
 that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £60.”
 
 [Illustration: “SHERLOCK HOLMES WELCOMED HER”]
 
 “I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand
 that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and
 so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of
 course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest
 every quarter, and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do
 pretty well with what I earn at type-writing. It brings me twopence a
 sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”
 
 “You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is
 my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before
 myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer
 Angel.”
 
 A flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at
 the fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,”
 she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then
 afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank
 did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would
 get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat.
 But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had
 he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
 father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit
 to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken
 out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off
 to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I,
 with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.
 Hosmer Angel.”
 
 “I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from
 France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”
 
 “Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
 shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a
 woman, for she would have her way.”
 
 “I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a
 gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”
 
 “Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we
 had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr.
 Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back
 again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”
 
 “No?”
 
 “Well, you know, father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t
 have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman
 should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to
 mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got
 mine yet.”
 
 “But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”
 
 “Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote
 and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until
 he had gone. We could write in the mean time, and he used to write
 every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need
 for father to know.”
 
 “Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”
 
 “Oh yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we
 took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall
 Street—and—”
 
 “What office?”
 
 “That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”
 
 “Where did he live, then?”
 
 “He slept on the premises.”
 
 “And you don’t know his address?”
 
 “No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”
 
 “Where did you address your letters, then?”
 
 “To the Leadenhall Street Post-office, to be left till called for. He
 said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all
 the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to
 type-write them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he
 said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they
 were type-written he always felt that the machine had come between us.
 That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the
 little things that he would think of.”
 
 “It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of
 mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you
 remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”
 
 “He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in
 the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be
",Holmes
10," fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was
 staring with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would
 look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping
 all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn’t lost anything, in such a
 very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran
 down his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about:
 getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that
 it was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod
 upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates
 stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from
 him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case,
 watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the
 spectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his
 pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over
 again.
 
 When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young
 ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet,
 and the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly
 turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.
 They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of
 colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being
 remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them
 very nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.
 
 The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence
 of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and
 the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length,
 Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.
 This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly
 afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went
 away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with
 money to spend.
 
 “There, my dear,” said Fagin. “That’s a pleasant life, isn’t it? They
 have gone out for the day.”
 
 “Have they done work, sir?” inquired Oliver.
 
 “Yes,” said the Jew; “that is, unless they should unexpectedly come
 across any, when they are out; and they won’t neglect it, if they do,
 my dear, depend upon it. Make ’em your models, my dear. Make ’em your
 models,” tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his
 words; “do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all
 matters—especially the Dodger’s, my dear. He’ll be a great man himself,
 and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.—Is my
 handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?” said the Jew, stopping
 short.
 
 “Yes, sir,” said Oliver.
 
 “See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do,
 when we were at play this morning.”
 
 Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen
 the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with
 the other.
 
 “Is it gone?” cried the Jew.
 
 “Here it is, sir,” said Oliver, showing it in his hand.
 
 “You’re a clever boy, my dear,” said the playful old gentleman, patting
 Oliver on the head approvingly. “I never saw a sharper lad. Here’s a
 shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you’ll be the greatest man
 of the time. And now come here, and I’ll show you how to take the marks
 out of the handkerchiefs.”
 
 Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman’s pocket in play, had to
 do with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew,
 being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to
 the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER X.
 OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW
 ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT,
 BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY
 
 
 For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew’s room, picking the marks out
 of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought
 home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which
 the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length,
 he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of
 earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work
 with his two companions.
 
 Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what
 he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman’s character.
 Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed,
 he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy
 habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by
 sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went
 so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was
 carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.
 
 At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so
 eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two
 or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these
 were reasons for the old gentleman’s giving his assent; but, whether
 they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the
 joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.
 
 The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,
 and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his
 hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they
 were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in,
 first.
 
 The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter,
 that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive
 the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a
 vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small
 boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some
 very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering
 divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and
 thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that
 they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.
 These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring
 his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when
 his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very
 mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.
 
 They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open
 square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion
 of terms, “The Green”: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying
 his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the
 greatest caution and circumspection.
 
 “What’s the matter?” demanded Oliver.
 
 “Hush!” replied the Dodger. “Do you see that old cove at the
 book-stall?”
 
 “The old gentleman over the way?” said Oliver. “Yes, I see him.”
 
 “He’ll do,” said the Dodger.
 
 “A prime plant,” observed Master Charley Bates.
 
 Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he
 was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked
 stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman
 towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces
 after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood
 looking on in silent amazement.
 
 The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a
 powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green
 coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a
 smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall,
 and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his
 elbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied
 himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he
 saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short,
 anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through:
 turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at
 the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest
 interest and eagerness.
 
 What was Oliver’s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking
 on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the
 Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman’s pocket, and draw from
 thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and
 finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full
 speed!
 
 In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches,
 and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy’s mind.
 
 He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his
 veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then,
 confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he
 did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.
 
 This was all done in a minute’s space. In the very instant when Oliver
 began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and
 missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding
 away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the
 depredator; and shouting “Stop thief!” with all his might, made off
 after him, book in hand.
 
 But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the
 hue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public
 attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the
 very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and
 saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they
 issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting “Stop thief!” too,
 joined in the pursuit like good citizens.
 
 Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not
 theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that
 self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps
 he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it
 alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old
 gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.
 
 “Stop thief! Stop thief!” There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman
 leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down
 his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy
 his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the
 child his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter,
 slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as
 they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls:
 and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.
 
 “Stop thief! Stop thief!” The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and
 the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through
 the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run
 the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the
 very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the
 shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, “Stop thief! Stop thief!”
 
 “Stop thief! Stop thief!” There is a passion FOR _hunting_ _something_
 deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child,
 panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large
 drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to
 make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain
 upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.
 “Stop thief!” Ay, stop him for God’s sake, were it only in mercy!
 
 Stopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the
 crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling
 with the others to catch a glimpse. “Stand aside!” “Give him a little
 air!” “Nonsense! he don’t deserve it.” “Where’s the gentleman?” “Here
 his is, coming down the street.” “Make room there for the gentleman!”
 “Is this the boy, sir!” “Yes.”
 
 Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,
 looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when
 the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by
 the foremost of the pursuers.
 
 “Yes,” said the gentleman, “I am afraid it is the boy.”
 
 “Afraid!” murmured the crowd. “That’s a good ’un!”
 
 “Poor fellow!” said the gentleman, “he has hurt himself.”
 
 “_I_ did that, sir,” said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward;
 “and preciously I cut my knuckle agin’ his mouth. I stopped him, sir.”
 
 The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his
 pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of
 dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away
 himself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and
 thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is
 generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made
 his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.
 
 “Come, get up,” said the man, roughly.
 
 “It wasn’t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,” said
 Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. “They are
 here somewhere.”
 
 “Oh no, they ain’t,” said the officer. He meant this to be ironical,
 but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off
 down the first convenient court they came to.
 
 “Come, get up!”
 
 “Don’t hurt him,” said the old gentleman, compassionately.
 
 “Oh no, I won’t hurt him,” replied the officer, tearing his jacket half
 off his back, in proof thereof. “Come, I know you; it won’t do. Will
 you stand upon your legs, you young devil?”
 
 Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his
 feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at
 a rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officer’s side;
 and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead,
 and stared back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in
 triumph; and on they went.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XI.
 TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT
 SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE
 
 
 The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the
 immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.
 The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two
 or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led
 beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of
 summary justice, by the back way. It was a small paved yard into which
 they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of
 whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.
 
 “What’s the matter now?” said the man carelessly.
 
 “A young fogle-hunter,” replied the man who had Oliver in charge.
 
 “Are you the party that’s been robbed, sir?” inquired the man with the
 keys.
 
 “Yes, I am,” replied the old gentleman; “but I am not sure that this
 boy actually took the handkerchief. I—I would rather not press the
 case.”
 
 “Must go before the magistrate now, sir,” replied the man. “His worship
 will be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young gallows!”
 
 This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he
 unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was
 searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.
 
 This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not
 so light. It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and
 it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up,
 elsewhere, since Saturday night. But this is little. In our
 station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most
 trivial charges—the word is worth noting—in dungeons, compared with
 which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried,
 found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who
 doubts this, compare the two.
 
 The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated
 in the lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the
 innocent cause of all this disturbance.
 
 “There is something in that boy’s face,” said the old gentleman to
 himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of
 the book, in a thoughtful manner; “something that touches and interests
 me. _Can_ he be innocent? He looked like—Bye the bye,” exclaimed the
 old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky,
 “Bless my soul!—where have I seen something like that look before?”
 
 After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same
 meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there,
 retiring into a corner, called up before his mind’s eye a vast
 amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many
 years. “No,” said the old gentleman, shaking his head; “it must be
 imagination.”
 
 He wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was
 not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There
 were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost
 strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of
 young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that
 the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to
 its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling
 back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming
 of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond
 the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be
 set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to
 Heaven.
 
 But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver’s
 features bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he
 awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman,
 buried them again in the pages of the musty book.
 
 He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man
 with the keys to follow him into the office. He closed his book
 hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the
 renowned Mr. Fang.
 
 The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. Mr. Fang sat
 behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of
 wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling
 very much at the awfulness of the scene.
 
 Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with
 no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and
 sides of his head. His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were
 really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good
 for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for
 libel, and have recovered heavy damages.
 
 The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate’s
 desk, said, suiting the action to the word, “That is my name and
 address, sir.” He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite
 and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.
 
 Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading
 article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent
 decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth
 time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State
 for the Home Department. He was out of temper; and he looked up with an
 angry scowl.
 
 “Who are you?” said Mr. Fang.
 
 The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.
 
 “Officer!” said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the
 newspaper. “Who is this fellow?”
 
 “My name, sir,” said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman,
 “my name, sir, is Brownlow. Permit me to inquire the name of the
 magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a
 respectable person, under the protection of the bench.” Saying this,
 Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person
 who would afford him the required information.
 
 “Officer!” said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, “what’s this
 fellow charged with?”
 
 “He’s not charged at all, your worship,” replied the officer. “He
 appears against this boy, your worship.”
 
 His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and
 a safe one.
 
 “Appears against the boy, does he?” said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr.
 Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot. “Swear him!”
 
 “Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,” said Mr. Brownlow;
 “and that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could
 have believed—”
 
 “Hold your tongue, sir!” said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.
 
 “I will not, sir!” replied the old gentleman.
 
 “Hold your tongue this instant, or I’ll have you turned out of the
 office!” said Mr. Fang. “You’re an insolent impertinent fellow. How
 dare you bully a magistrate!”
 
 “What!” exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.
 
 “Swear this person!” said Fang to the clerk. “I’ll not hear another
 word. Swear him.”
 
 Mr. Brownlow’s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps,
 that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed
 his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.
 
 “Now,” said Fang, “what’s the charge against this boy? What have you
 got to say, sir?”
 
 “I was standing at a bookstall—” Mr. Brownlow began.
 
 “Hold your tongue, sir,” said Mr. Fang. “Policeman! Where’s the
 policeman? Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what is this?”
 
 The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the
 charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person;
 and how that was all he knew about it.
 
 “Are there any witnesses?” inquired Mr. Fang.
 
 “None, your worship,” replied the policeman.
 
 Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the
 prosecutor, said in a towering passion.
 
 “Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or
 do you not? You have been sworn. Now, if you stand there, refusing to
 give evidence, I’ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will,
 by—”
 
 By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed
 very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy
 book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being
 heard—accidently, of course.
 
 With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived
 to state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he
 had run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and
 expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him,
 although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he
 would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.
 
 “He has been hurt already,” said the old gentleman in conclusion. “And
 I fear,” he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, “I
 really fear that he is ill.”
 
 “Oh! yes, I dare say!” said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. “Come, none of your
 tricks here, you young vagabond; they won’t do. What’s your name?”
 
 Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him. He was deadly pale;
 and the whole place seemed turning round and round.
 
 “What’s your name, you hardened scoundrel?” demanded Mr. Fang.
 “Officer, what’s his name?”
 
 This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who
 was standing by the bar. He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry;
 but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and
 knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the
 more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess.
 
 “He says his name’s Tom White, your worship,” said the kind-hearted
 thief-taker.
 
 “Oh, he won’t speak out, won’t he?” said Fang. “Very well, very well.
 Where does he live?”
 
 “Where he can, your worship,” replied the officer; again pretending to
 receive Oliver’s answer.
 
 “Has he any parents?” inquired Mr. Fang.
 
 “He says they died in his infancy, your worship,” replied the officer:
 hazarding the usual reply.
 
 At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking
 round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of
 water.
 
 “Stuff and nonsense!” said Mr. Fang: “don’t try to make a fool of me.”
 
 “I think he really is ill, your worship,” remonstrated the officer.
 
 “I know better,” said Mr. Fang.
 
 “Take care of him, officer,” said the old gentleman, raising his hands
 instinctively; “he’ll fall down.”
 
 “Stand away, officer,” cried Fang; “let him, if he likes.”
 
 Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in
 a fainting fit. The men in the office looked at each other, but no one
 dared to stir.
 
 “I knew he was shamming,” said Fang, as if this were incontestable
 proof of the fact. “Let him lie there; he’ll soon be tired of that.”
 
 “How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?” inquired the clerk in
 a low voice.
 
 “Summarily,” replied Mr. Fang. “He stands committed for three
 months—hard labour of course. Clear the office.”
 
 The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were
 preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man
 of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed
 hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.
 
 “Stop, stop! don’t take him away! For Heaven’s sake stop a moment!”
 cried the new comer, breathless with haste.
 
 Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a
 summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the
 character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty’s subjects, especially of
 the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic
 tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are
 closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily
 press.[Footnote: Or were virtually, then.] Mr. Fang was consequently
 not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such
 irreverent disorder.
 
 “What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the office!” cried
 Mr. Fang.
 
 “I _will_ speak,” cried the man; “I will not be turned out. I saw it
 all. I keep the book-stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be put
 down. Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You must not refuse, sir.”
 
 The man was right. His manner was determined; and the matter was
 growing rather too serious to be hushed up.
 
 “Swear the man,” growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. “Now, man,
 what have you got to say?”
 
 “This,” said the man: “I saw three boys: two others and the prisoner
 here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman
 was reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done;
 and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.”
 Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall
 keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact
 circumstances of the robbery.
 
 “Why didn’t you come here before?” said Fang, after a pause.
 
 “I hadn’t a soul to mind the shop,” replied the man. “Everybody who
 could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody
 till five minutes ago; and I’ve run here all the way.”
 
 “The prosecutor was reading, was he?” inquired Fang, after another
 pause.
 
 “Yes,” replied the man. “The very book he has in his hand.”
 
 “Oh, that book, eh?” said Fang. “Is it paid for?”
 
 “No, it is not,” replied the man, with a smile.
 
 “Dear me, I forgot all about it!” exclaimed the absent old gentleman,
 innocently.
 
 “A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!” said Fang, with
 a comical effort to look humane. “I consider, sir, that you have
 obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and
 disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate
 that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a
 lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet. The boy is
 discharged. Clear the office!”
 
 “D—n me!” cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had
 kept down so long, “d—n me! I’ll—”
 
 “Clear the office!” said the magistrate. “Officers, do you hear? Clear
 the office!”
 
 The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed
 out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a
 perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance. He reached the yard; and his
 passion vanished in a moment. Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on
 the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with
 water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole
 frame.
 
 “Poor boy, poor boy!” said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. “Call a
 coach, somebody, pray. Directly!”
 
 A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the
 seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.
 
 “May I accompany you?” said the book-stall keeper, looking in.
 
 “Bless me, yes, my dear sir,” said Mr. Brownlow quickly. “I forgot you.
 Dear, dear! I have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor fellow!
 There’s no time to lose.”
 
 The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XII.
 IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN
 WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL
 FRIENDS.
 
 
 The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which
 Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the
 Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at
 Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady
 street near Pentonville. Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of
 time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and
 comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and
 solicitude that knew no bounds.
 
 But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of
 his new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and
 many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy
 bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever. The worm
 does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow
 creeping fire upon the living frame.
 
 Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have
 been a long and troubled dream. Feebly raising himself in the bed, with
 his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.
 
 “What room is this? Where have I been brought to?” said Oliver. “This
 is not the place I went to sleep in.”
 
 He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak;
 but they were overheard at once. The curtain at the bed’s head was
 hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely
 dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which
 she had been sitting at needle-work.
 
 “Hush, my dear,” said the old lady softly. “You must be very quiet, or
 you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,—as bad as bad could
 be, pretty nigh. Lie down again; there’s a dear!” With those words, the
 old lady very gently placed Oliver’s head upon the pillow; and,
 smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving
 in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in
 hers, and drawing it round his neck.
 
 “Save us!” said the old lady, with tears in her eyes. “What a grateful
 little dear it is. Pretty creetur! What would his mother feel if she
 had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!”
 
 “Perhaps she does see me,” whispered Oliver, folding his hands
 together; “perhaps she has sat by me. I almost feel as if she had.”
 
 “That was the fever, my dear,” said the old lady mildly.
 
 “I suppose it was,” replied Oliver, “because heaven is a long way off;
 and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor
 boy. But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there;
 for she was very ill herself before she died. She can’t know anything
 about me though,” added Oliver after a moment’s silence. “If she had
 seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always
 looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.”
 
 The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her
 spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were
 part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver
 to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very
 quiet, or he would be ill again.
 
 So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the
 kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he
 was completely exhausted with what he had already said. He soon fell
 into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a
 candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with
 a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his
 pulse, and said he was a great deal better.
 
 “You _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?” said the
 gentleman.
 
 “Yes, thank you, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Yes, I know you are,” said the gentleman: “You’re hungry too, an’t
 you?”
 
 “No, sir,” answered Oliver.
 
 “Hem!” said the gentleman. “No, I know you’re not. He is not hungry,
 Mrs. Bedwin,” said the gentleman: looking very wise.
 
 The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to
 say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor
 appeared much of the same opinion himself.
 
 “You feel sleepy, don’t you, my dear?” said the doctor.
 
 “No, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “No,” said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. “You’re
 not sleepy. Nor thirsty. Are you?”
 
 “Yes, sir, rather thirsty,” answered Oliver.
 
 “Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,” said the doctor. “It’s very natural
 that he should be thirsty. You may give him a little tea, ma’am, and
 some dry toast without any butter. Don’t keep him too warm, ma’am; but
 be careful that you don’t let him be too cold; will you have the
 goodness?”
 
 The old lady dropped a curtsey. The doctor, after tasting the cool
 stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his
 boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went
 downstairs.
 
 Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly
 twelve o’clock. The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly
 afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just
 come: bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a
 large nightcap. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the
 table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up
 with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series
 of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings
 forward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse
 effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep
 again.
 
 And thus the night crept slowly on. Oliver lay awake for some time,
 counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the
 rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid
 eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and
 the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into
 the boy’s mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many
 days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his
 awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently
 prayed to Heaven.
 
 Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent
 suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain
 to wake from. Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the
 struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its
 anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the
 past!
 
 It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt
 cheerful and happy. The crisis of the disease was safely past. He
 belonged to the world again.
 
 In three days’ time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped
 up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had
 him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper’s room, which
 belonged to her. Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old
 lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable
 delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most
 violently.
 
 “Never mind me, my dear,” said the old lady; “I’m only having a regular
 good cry. There; it’s all over now; and I’m quite comfortable.”
 
 “You’re very, very kind to me, ma’am,” said Oliver.
 
 “Well, never you mind that, my dear,” said the old lady; “that’s got
 nothing to do with your broth; and it’s full time you had it; for the
 doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we
 must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he’ll
 be pleased.” And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up,
 in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver
 thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation
 strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest
 computation.
 
 “Are you fond of pictures, dear?” inquired the old lady, seeing that
 Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung
 against the wall; just opposite his chair.
 
 “I don’t quite know, ma’am,” said Oliver, without taking his eyes from
 the canvas; “I have seen so few that I hardly know. What a beautiful,
 mild face that lady’s is!”
 
 “Ah!” said the old lady, “painters always make ladies out prettier than
 they are, or they wouldn’t get any custom, child. The man that invented
 the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never
 succeed; it’s a deal too honest. A deal,” said the old lady, laughing
 very heartily at her own acuteness.
 
 “Is—is that a likeness, ma’am?” said Oliver.
 
 “Yes,” said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth;
 “that’s a portrait.”
 
 “Whose, ma’am?” asked Oliver.
 
 “Why, really, my dear, I don’t know,” answered the old lady in a
 good-humoured manner. “It’s not a likeness of anybody that you or I
 know, I expect. It seems to strike your fancy, dear.”
 
 “It is so pretty,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Why, sure you’re not afraid of it?” said the old lady: observing in
 great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the
 painting.
 
 “Oh no, no,” returned Oliver quickly; “but the eyes look so sorrowful;
 and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. It makes my heart beat,”
 added Oliver in a low voice, “as if it was alive, and wanted to speak
 to me, but couldn’t.”
 
 “Lord save us!” exclaimed the old lady, starting; “don’t talk in that
 way, child. You’re weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel
 your chair round to the other side; and then you won’t see it. There!”
 said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; “you don’t see it
 now, at all events.”
 
 Oliver _did_ see it in his mind’s eye as distinctly as if he had not
 altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind
 old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin,
 satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of
 toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a
 preparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition. He
 had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at
 the door. “Come in,” said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.
 
 Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no
 sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands
 behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at
 Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd
 contortions. Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and
 made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his
 benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again;
 and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow’s heart,
 being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane
 disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic
 process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a
 condition to explain.
 
 “Poor boy, poor boy!” said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. “I’m
 rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin. I’m afraid I have caught
 cold.”
 
 “I hope not, sir,” said Mrs. Bedwin. “Everything you have had, has been
 well aired, sir.”
 
 “I don’t know, Bedwin. I don’t know,” said Mr. Brownlow; “I rather
 think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind
 that. How do you feel, my dear?”
 
 “Very happy, sir,” replied Oliver. “And very grateful indeed, sir, for
 your goodness to me.”
 
 “Good by,” said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. “Have you given him any
 nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?”
 
 “He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,” replied Mrs.
 Bedwin: drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the
 last word: to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded,
 there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.
 
 “Ugh!” said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; “a couple of glasses
 of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn’t they,
 Tom White, eh?”
 
 “My name is Oliver, sir,” replied the little invalid: with a look of
 great astonishment.
 
 “Oliver,” said Mr. Brownlow; “Oliver what? Oliver White, eh?”
 
 “No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.”
 
 “Queer name!” said the old gentleman. “What made you tell the
 magistrate your name was White?”
 
 “I never told him so, sir,” returned Oliver in amazement.
 
 This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked
 somewhat sternly in Oliver’s face. It was impossible to doubt him;
 there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.
 
 “Some mistake,” said Mr. Brownlow. But, although his motive for looking
 steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance
 between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly,
 that he could not withdraw his gaze.
 
 “I hope you are not angry with me, sir?” said Oliver, raising his eyes
 beseechingly.
 
 “No, no,” replied the old gentleman. “Why! what’s this? Bedwin, look
 there!”
 
 As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver’s head, and
 then to the boy’s face. There was its living copy. The eyes, the head,
 the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the
 instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with
 startling accuracy!
 
 Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being
 strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away. A
 weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of
 relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils
 of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording—
 
 That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined
 in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver’s heels, in consequence
 of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow’s personal
 property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very
 laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the
 freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the
 first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need
 hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt
 them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great
 a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own
 preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code
 of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid
 down as the main-springs of all Nature’s deeds and actions: the said
 philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady’s proceedings to
 matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment
 to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight
 any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For,
 these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by
 universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and
 weaknesses of her sex.
 
 If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of
 the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate
 predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a
 foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when
 the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for
 their home by the shortest possible cut. Although I do not mean to
 assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages,
 to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being
 rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and
 discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the
 pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I
 do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable
 practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories,
",OliverTwist
11," herself and the letters and diary she had left me, the rough notes. We
 had strange little absurd arguments. I told her not to doubt that I
 would write her story, because I loved writing, I lived to write, every
 day was empty that held no written word, that I only lived my fullest,
 my completest when I was at my desk, when there was wide horizon for my
 eyes and I saw the real true imagined people with whom I was more
 intimate than with any I met at receptions and crowded dinner-parties.
 
 “The absurdity is that any one who feels what you describe should write
 so badly. It is incredible that you should have the temperament of the
 writer without the talent,” she said to me once.
 
 “What makes you say I write badly? I sell well!” I told her what I got
 for my books, and about my dear American public.
 
 “Sell! sell!” She was quite contemptuous. “Hall Caine sells better than
 you do, and Marie Corelli, and Mrs. Barclay.”
 
 “Would you rather I gave one of them your MS.?” I asked pettishly. I was
 vexed with her now, but I did not want her to go. She used to vanish
 suddenly like a light blown out. I think that was when I fell asleep,
 but I did not want to keep awake always, or hear her talking. She was
 inclined to be melancholy, or cynical, and so jarred my mood, my sense
 of well-being.
 
 Night and morning they gave me my injections of morphia, until the
 morning when I refused it, to Dr. Kennedy’s surprise and against
 Benham’s remonstrance.
 
 “It is good for you, you are not going to set yourself against it?”
 
 “I can have it again tonight. I don’t need it in the daytime. The
 hæmorrhage has left off.” Dr. Kennedy supported me in my refusal. I will
 admit the next few days were dreadful. I found myself utterly ill and
 helpless, and horribly conscious of all that was going on. The detail of
 desperate illness is almost unbearable to a thinking person of decent
 and reticent physical habits. The feeding cup and gurgling water bed,
 the lack of privacy, are hourly humiliations. All one’s modesties are
 outraged. I improved, although as I heard afterwards it had not been
 expected that I would live. The consultants gave me up, and the nurses.
 Only Dr. Kennedy and Ella refused to admit the condition hopeless. When
 I continued to improve Ella was boastful and Benham contradictory. The
 one dressed me up, making pretty lace and ribbon caps, sending to London
 for wonderful dressing-jackets and nightgowns, pretending I was out of
 danger and on the road to convalescence, long before I even had a normal
 temperature. Benham fought against all the indulgences that Ella and I
 ordered and Dr. Kennedy never opposed. Seeing visitors, sitting up in
 bed, reading the newspapers, abandoning invalid diet in favour of
 caviare and foie gras, strange rich dishes. Benham despised Dr. Kennedy
 and said we could always get round him, make him say whatever we wished.
 More than once she threatened to throw up the case. I did not want her
 to go. I knew, if I did not admit it, that my convalescence was not
 established. I had no real confidence in myself, was much weaker than
 anybody but myself knew, with disquieting symptoms. It exhausted me to
 fight with her continually, one day I told her so, and that she was
 retarding my recovery. “I am older than you, and I hate to be ordered
 about or contradicted.”
 
 “But I am so much more experienced in illness. You know I only want to
 do what is best for you. You are not strong enough to do half the things
 you are doing. You turn Dr. Kennedy round your little finger, you and
 Mrs. Lovegrove. He knows well enough you ought not to be getting up and
 seeing people. You will want to go down next. And as for the things you
 eat!”
 
 “I shall go down next week. I suppose I shall be exhausted before I get
 there, arguing with you whether I ought or ought not to go.”
 
 By this time I had got rid of the night nurse, Benham looked after me
 night and day devotedly. I was no longer indifferent to her. She angered
 me nevertheless, and we quarrelled bitterly. The least drawback,
 however, and I could not bear her out of the room. She did not reproach
 me, I must say that for her. When a horrible bilious attack followed an
 invalid dinner of melon and _homard à l’américaine_ she stood by my side
 for hours trying every conceivable remedy. And without a word of
 reproach.
 
 After my hæmorrhage I had a few weeks’ rest from the neuritis and then
 it started again. I cried out for my forsaken nepenthe, but Peter
 Kennedy and Nurse Benham for once agreed, persuaded or forced me to
 codein. Dear half-sister to my beloved morphia, we became friends at
 once. Three or four days later the neuritis went suddenly, and has never
 returned. One night I took the nepenthe as well, and that night I saw
 Margaret Capel again.
 
 “When are you going to begin?” she asked me at once.
 
 “The very moment I can hold a pen. Now my hand shakes. And Ella or nurse
 is always here—I am never alone.”
 
 “You’ve forgotten all about me,” she said with indescribable sadness.
 “You won’t write it at all.”
 
 “No, I haven’t. I shall. But when one has been so ill ...” I pleaded.
 
 “Other people write when they are ill. You remember Green, and Robert
 Louis Stevenson. As for me, I never felt well.”
 
 The next day, before Dr. Kennedy came, I asked Benham to leave us alone
 together. He still came daily, but she disapproved of his methods and
 told me that she only stayed in the room and gave him her report because
 she thought it her duty. They were temperamentally opposed. She had the
 scientific mind and believed in authority. His was imaginative,
 desultory, doubtful, but wide and enquiring. Both of them were
 interested in me, so at least Ella told me. She was satisfied now with
 my doctoring and nursing. At least a week had passed since she suggested
 a substitute for either.
 
 Dr. Kennedy, when we were alone, said, as he did when nurse was standing
 there:
 
 “Well! how are you getting on?”
 
 “Splendidly.” And then, without any circumlocution, although we had not
 spoken of the matter for weeks, and so much had occurred in the
 meantime, I asked him: “What did you do about that packet? I want it
 now. I am quite well enough.”
 
 “You have not seen her since?”
 
 “Over and over again. She thinks I am shirking my responsibilities.”
 
 “Are you well enough to write?”
 
 “I am well enough to read. When will you bring me the letters?”
 
 “I brought them when I said I would, the day you were taken ill.”
 
 “Where are they?”
 
 “In the first drawer, the right-hand drawer of the chest of drawers.” He
 turned round to it. “That is, if they have not been moved. I put the
 packet there myself, told nurse it was something that was not to be
 touched. The morphia things are in the same place. I don’t know what she
 thinks it is, some new and useless drug or apparatus; she has no opinion
 of me, you know. I used to see it night and morning, as long as you were
 having the injections.”
 
 “See if it is there now.”
 
 He went over and opened the drawer:
 
 “It is there right enough.”
 
 “Oh! don’t be like nurse,” I said impatiently. “I am strong enough to
 look at the packet.”
 
 He gave it to me, into my hands, an ordinary brown paper parcel, tied
 with string and heavily, awkwardly, splotched and protected with
 sealing-wax. I could have sworn to his handiwork.
 
 “Why are you smiling?” he asked.
 
 “Only at the neatness of your parcel.” He smiled too.
 
 “I tied it up in a hurry. I didn’t want to be tempted to look inside.”
 
 “So you make me guardian and executrix....”
 
 “Margaret herself said you were to have them,” he answered seriously.
 
 “She didn’t tell you so. You have only my word for it,” I retorted.
 
 “Better evidence than that, although that would have been enough. How
 else did you know they were in existence? Why were you looking for
 them?”
 
 The parcel lay on the quilt, and all sorts of difficulties rose in my
 mind. I would not open it unless I was alone, and I was never alone;
 literally never alone unless I was supposed to be asleep. And, thanks to
 codein, when I was supposed to be asleep the supposition was generally
 correct! Thinking aloud, I asked Dr. Kennedy:
 
 “Am I out of danger?”
 
 He answered lightly and evasively:
 
 “No one is ever really out of danger. I take my life in my hands every
 time I go in my motor.”
 
 “Oh, yes! I’ve heard about your driving,” I answered drily.
 
 He laughed.
 
 “I am supposed to be reckless, but really I am only unlucky. With luck
 now....”
 
 “Yes, with luck?”
 
 “You might go on for any time. I shouldn’t worry about that if I were
 you. You are getting better.”
 
 “I am not worrying, only thinking about Mrs. Lovegrove. She has two
 children, a large house, literary and other engagements. Will you tell
 her I am well enough to be left alone?” He answered quickly and
 surprised:
 
 “She does not want to go, she likes being with you. Not that I wonder at
 that.”
 
 He was a strange person. Sometimes I had an idea he was not “all there.”
 He said whatever came into his mind, and had other divergencies from the
 ordinary type. I had to explain to him my need of solitude. If Ella went
 back to town, Benham would soon, I hoped, with a little encouragement,
 fall into the way of ordinary nurses. I had had them in London and knew
 their habits. Two or three hours in the morning for their so-called
 “constitutionals,” two or three hours in the afternoon for sleep,
 whether they had been disturbed in the night or not; in the intervals
 there were the meals over which they lingered. Solitude would be easily
 secured if Ella went away and there was no one to watch or comment on
 the amount of attention purchased or purchasable for two guineas a week.
 I misread Benham, by the way, but that is a detail. She was not like the
 average nurse, and never behaved in the same way.
 
 My first objective, once that brown paper parcel lay on the bed, was to
 persuade Ella to go back to home and children. Without hurting her
 feelings. She would not have left the house for five minutes before I
 should be longing for her back again. I knew that, but one cannot work
 _and_ play. I have never had any other companion but Ella. Still....
 _Work whilst ye have the light._ One more book I _must_ do, and here was
 one to my hand.
 
 I made Dr. Kennedy put the parcel back in the drawer. Then I lay and
 made plans. I must talk to Ella of Violet and Tommy, make her homesick
 for them. Unfortunately Ella knew me so well. I started that very
 afternoon.
 
 “How does Violet get on without you?”
 
 “She is all right.”
 
 But soon afterwards Ella asked me quietly whether there was any one else
 I would like down.
 
 “God forbid!” I answered in alarm, and she understood, understood
 without showing pang or offence, that I wanted to be alone. One thing
 Ella never quite realised, my wretched inability to live in two worlds
 at once, the real and the unreal. When I want to write there is no use
 giving me certain hours or times to myself. I want all the days and all
 the nights. I don’t wish to be spoken to, nor torn away from my story
 and new friends. For this reason I have always had to leave London many
 months in the year, for the seaside or abroad. London meant Ella, almost
 daily, at the telephone if not personally.
 
 “You don’t write all day, do you? What are you pretending? Don’t be so
 absurd, you must go out sometimes. I am fetching you in the car at....”
 
 And then I was lured by her to theatres, dinners, lunches. She thought
 people liked to meet me, but I have rarely noticed any interest taken in
 a female novelist, however many editions she may run through. My
 strength was returning, if slowly. Ella of course had duties to those
 children of hers that sometimes I resented so unreasonably. I always
 wished her early widowhood had left her without ties. However, the call
 of them came in usefully now; it was not necessary for me to press it. I
 came first with her, I exulted in it. But since I was getting better....
 
 I wished to be alone with that parcel. I did make a tentative effort
 before Ella left.
 
 “I don’t want to settle off to sleep just yet, nurse, I should like to
 read a little. There is a packet of letters....”
 
 “No! No! I wouldn’t hear of such a thing. Starting reading at ten
 o’clock. What will you be wanting to do next?”
 
 “It would not do me any harm,” I answered irritably. “I’ve told you
 before it does me more harm to be contradicted every time I make a
 suggestion.”
 
 “Well, you won’t get me to help you to commit suicide. Night is the time
 for sleep, and you’ve had your codein.”
 
 “The codein does not send me to sleep, it only soothes and quiets me.”
 
 “All the more reason you should not wake yourself up by any old
 letters.” She argued, and I.... At the end I was too tired and out of
 humour to insist. I made up my mind to do without a nurse as soon as
 possible, and in the meantime not to argue but to circumvent her. At
 this time, before Ella went, I was getting up every day for a few hours,
 lying on the couch by the window. I tested my strength and found I could
 walk from bed to sofa, from sofa to easy-chair without nurse’s arm, if I
 made the effort.
 
 “You _will_ take care of yourself?” were Ella’s last words, and I
 promised impatiently.
 
 “I don’t so much mind leaving you alone now, you have your Peter, and
 nurse won’t let you overdo things.”
 
 “_You have your Peter._” Can one imagine anything more ridiculous! My
 incurably frivolous sister imagined I had fallen in love, with that
 lout! I was unable to persuade her to the contrary. She argued, that at
 my worst and before, I would have no other attendant. And she pointed
 out that it could not possibly be Peter Kennedy’s skill that attracted
 me. I defended him, feebly perhaps, for it was true that he had not
 shown any special aptitude or ability. I said he was quite as good as
 any of the others, and certainly less depressing.
 
 “There is no good humbugging me, or trying to. You are in love with the
 man. Don’t trouble to contradict it. And I am not a bit jealous. I only
 hope he will make you happy. Nurse told me you do not even like her to
 come into the room when he is here.”
 
 “Don’t you know how old I am? It is really undignified, humiliating, to
 be talked to or of in that way....”
 
 “Age has nothing to do with it. A woman is never too old to fall in
 love. And besides, what is thirty-nine?”
 
 “In this case it is forty-two,” I put in drily, my sense of humour not
 being entirely in abeyance.
 
 “Well! or forty-two. Anyway you will admit I took a hint very quickly. I
 am going to leave you alone with your Corydon.”
 
 “Caliban!”
 
 “He is not bad-looking really, it is only his clothes. And if anything
 comes of it you will send him to Poole’s. Anyway his feet and hands are
 all right, and there is a certain grace about his ungainliness.”
 
 “Really, Ella, I can’t bear any more. Love runs in your head; feeds your
 activities, agrees with you. But as for me, I’ve long outgrown it. I am
 tired, old, ill. Peter Kennedy is just not objectionable. Other doctors
 are. He is honest, simple....”
 
 “I will hear all about his qualities next time I come. Only don’t think
 you are deceiving me. God bless you, dear.” She turned suddenly serious.
 “You know I would not go if you wanted me to stop or if I were uneasy
 about you any more. You know I will come down again at any moment you
 want me. I shall miss my train if I don’t rush. Can I send you anything?
 I won’t forget the sofa rug, and if you think of anything else....” Her
 maid knocked at the door and said the flyman had called up to say she
 must come at once. Her last words were: “Well, good-bye again, and tell
 him I give my consent. Tell him he gave the show away himself. I have
 known about it ever since the first night I was here when he told me
 what an interesting woman you were....”
 
 “Good-bye ... thanks for everything. I’m sorry you’ve got that mad idea
 in your silly head....” She was gone. I heard her voice outside the
 window giving directions to the man and then the crunch of the fly
 wheels on the gravel as she was driven away.
 
 
 
 
                                CHAPTER IV
 
 
 That night, the very night after Ella had gone, I tested my slowly
 returning strength. Benham gave me my codein, and saw that I was well
 provided with all I might need for the night; the lemonade and glycerine
 lozenges, a second codein on the table by my side, the electric bell to
 my hand. This bell had been put up since the night nurse left; it rang
 into Benham’s bedroom. I waited for a quarter of an hour after she had
 gone, she had a habit of coming back to see if I had forgotten anything,
 or to show me how thick and abundant her hair was without the uniform
 cap. I should have felt like a criminal when I stole out of bed. But I
 did not, I felt like an invalid, and a feeble one at that. It was only a
 couple of steps from the bed to the chest of drawers and I accomplished
 it without mishap, then was back again in bed, only to remember the
 seals were still unbroken and the string firm. A pair of nail scissors
 were on the dressing-table. I was disinclined for the journey, but
 managed it all the same. I was then so exhausted I had to wait for a
 quarter of an hour before I was able to use them. Only then was my
 curiosity rewarded. A small number of letters, not more than fifteen or
 sixteen in all, a bound diary, a very cursory glance at which showed me
 the disingenuousness, and half a dozen pages of MS. notes or chapter
 headings with several trial titles, “Between the Nisi and the Absolute,”
 “Publisher and Sinner,” headed two separate pages. “The Story of an
 Unhappy Woman” the third. The notes were all in the first person, and I
 should have known them anywhere for Margaret Capel’s.
 
 Small as the whole _cache_ was, I did not think it possible I could get
 through it all that night. Neither did it seem possible to get out of
 bed again. The papers must remain where they were, or underneath my
 pillow. I should be strong enough, I hoped, by the morning to put up
 with or confront any wrath or argument Benham would advance.
 
 I had got up because I chose. That was the beginning and end of it. She
 must learn to put up with my ways, or I with a change of nurse.
 
 The letters were in an elastic band, without envelopes, labelled and
 numbered. Margaret’s were on paper of a light mauve, with lines, like
 foreign paper. Her handwriting, masculine and square, was not very
 readable. She rarely dotted an _i_ or crossed a _t_, used the Greek _e_
 and many ellipses. Gabriel’s letters were as easy to read as print. It
 was a pity therefore that hers were so much longer than his. Still, once
 I began I was sorry to leave off, and should not have done so if I could
 have kept my eyes open or my attention from wandering. I am printing
 them just as they stand, those that I read that night, at least. Here
 they are:—
 
   No. 1.
 
                                        211 Queen Anne’s Gate, S.W.,

   _Dear Sirs_:—
 
   Would you care to publish a book by me on Staffordshire Pottery?
   What I have in my mind is a limited _édition de luxe_, illustrated
   in colours, highly priced. I may say I have a collection which I
   believe to be unique, if not complete, upon which I propose to draw
   largely. Of course the matter would have to be discussed both from
   your point of view and, mine. This is merely to ask if you are open.
 
   My name is probably not unknown to you, or rather my pseudonym.
 
   The critics have been kind to my novels, and I see no reason why
   they should be less so to a monograph on a subject I thoroughly
   understand. Although perhaps that will be hard for them to forgive.
   For it will be reviewed, if at all, by critics less well informed.
 
                          Yours sincerely,
                MARGARET CAPEL (“_Simon Dare_”).
                    Author of “The Immoralists,”

   _Dear Madam_:—
 
   I have to thank you for your letter of yesterday with its suggestion
   for a book on Staffordshire Pottery.
 
   The subject is outside my own knowledge, but I find there is no
   comprehensive work dealing with it, a small elementary booklet
   published in the Midlands some three years ago being the only volume
   catalogued.
 
   In any case there can hardly be a large public for so special an
   interest, and it will probably be best, as you indicate, to issue a
   limited edition at a high price and appeal direct by prospectus to
   collectors. The success of the publication would be then largely
   dependent on the beauty of the illustrations and the general “get
   up” of the volume, for although I have no doubt your text will be
   excellent and accurate—it must be properly “dressed” to secure
   attention.
 
   Indeed I have the privilege of knowing your novels well. They have
   always appealed to me as having the cardinal qualities of courage
   and actuality. Complete frankness combined with delicacy and
   literary skill is so rare with modern-day writers that your work
   stands out.
 
   Could you very kindly make it convenient to call here so that we may
   discuss the details and plan for the Staffordshire book? This would
   save a good deal of correspondence.
 
   I will gladly keep any appointment you make—please avoid Saturday,
   as I try to take that day off at this time of year to go to a little
   fishing I have in Hampshire.
 
                                           Yours faithfully,
                                                       GABRIEL STANTON.

   _Dear Sir_:—
 
   I am obliged by your courteous letter, and will be with you at four
   o’clock whichever day suits you. I propose to bring with me a short
   synopsis of “The Staffordshire Potters, Their Inspiration and
   Results,” and also a couple of specimens from which you might make
   experiments for illustrations. I want to place the book definitely
   before writing it.
 
   Domestic circumstances with which I need not trouble you, they are I
   fear already public property, make it advisable I should remain, if
   not sequestered, at least practically in retreat for the next few
   months. I find I cannot concentrate my mind on a novel at this
   juncture. But my cottages and quaint figures, groups and animals,
   jugs and plates, retain their attraction, and I shall do a better
   book about them now, when I am dependent on things and isolated from
   people, than I should at any other time.
 
   It is good of you to say what you do about my novels, but I doubt if
   I shall ever write another. My courage has turned to cowardice, and
   under cross-examination I found my frankness was no longer complete.
   I have taken a dislike to humanity.
 
                                              Yours sincerely,
                                                        MARGARET CAPEL.

   _Dear Mr. Stanton_:—
 
   The agreement promised has not yet arrived; nor your photographer;
   but I have made a first selection for him, and I think you will find
   it sufficiently varied according to your suggestion. Thirty
   illustrations in colour and seventy in monochrome will give the
   cream of my collection, and be representative, although of course
   not exhaustive. I have 375 specimens, no two alike! Ten groups, with
   the dancing dogs for the half-title, six cottages, six single
   figures, and the rest animal pieces will all look well in the
   process you showed me. I propose the large so-called classical
   examples in monochrome; their undoubted coarseness will then be
   toned down in black or brown and none of their interest destroyed.
   Julia, Lady Tweeddale, has one piece of which I have never been able
   to secure a duplicate, and so has Mr. Montague Guest. Do you think
   it advisable to ask permission to photograph these for inclusion, or
   would it be better to use only my own collection, and keep to the
   personal note in the letterpress?
 
   Our brief interview gave me the feeling that I may ask you for help
   in any difficulty or perplexity that occurs in the preparation of a
   work so new to me. You were very kind to me. I daresay I seemed to
   you nervous and uncertain of how I meant to proceed. I felt like a
   trembling amateur in that big office of yours. I have never
   interviewed a publisher before; my novels always went by post—and
   came back that way too, at first! I had a false conception of
   publishers, based on—but I must not tell you upon whom it was based.
   Although why not? Perhaps you will recognise the portrait. A little
   pot-bellied person, Jewish or German, with a cough, or a sniff, or a
",Twilight
12," whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and
 plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted
 glasses against the glare.”
 
 “Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your step-father, returned
 to France?”
 
 “Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should
 marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest, and made
 me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I
 would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me
 swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his
 favor from the first, and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when
 they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father;
 but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him
 afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I
 didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask
 his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want
 to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
 company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the
 very morning of the wedding.”
 
 “It missed him, then?”
 
 “Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”
 
 “Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the
 Friday. Was it to be in church?”
 
 “Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s
 Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras
 Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he
 put us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which
 happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church
 first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step
 out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and
 looked, there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not
 imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own
 eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard
 anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”
 
 “It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said
 Holmes.
 
 “Oh no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the
 morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;
 and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate
 us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he
 would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a
 wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”
 
 “Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
 unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”
 
 “Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not
 have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”
 
 “But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”
 
 “None.”
 
 “One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”
 
 “She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”
 
 “And your father? Did you tell him?”
 
 “Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and
 that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could any
 one have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving
 me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got
 my money settled on him, there might be some reason; but Hosmer was
 very independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of
 mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?
 Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of! and I can’t sleep a wink at
 night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to
 sob heavily into it.
 
 “I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising; “and I
 have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight
 of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon
 it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your
 memory, as he has done from your life.”
 
 “Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”
 
 “I fear not.”
 
 “Then what has happened to him?”
 
 “You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate
 description of him, and any letters of his which you can spare.”
 
 “I advertised for him in last Saturday’s _Chronicle_,” said she. “Here
 is the slip, and here are four letters from him.”
 
 “Thank you. And your address?”
 
 “No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”
 
 “Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your
 father’s place of business?”
 
 “He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of
 Fenchurch Street.”
 
 “Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave
 the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let
 the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your
 life.”
 
 “You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true
 to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”
 
 For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something
 noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.
 She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table, and went her way,
 with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
 
 Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger-tips still
 pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze
 directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the
 old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having
 lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths
 spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.
 
 “Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her
 more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather
 a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in
 Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last
 year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which
 were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”
 
 “You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to
 me,” I remarked.
 
 “Not invisible, but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,
 and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to
 realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,
 or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you
 gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”
 
 “Well, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather
 of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it,
 and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather
 darker than coffee color, with a little purple plush at the neck and
 sleeves. Her gloves were grayish, and were worn through at the right
 forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small, round, hanging
 gold ear-rings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do, in a
 vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
 
 “’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
 really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
 everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you
 have a quick eye for color. Never trust to general impressions, my boy,
 but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a
 woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee
 of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves,
 which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line
 a little above the wrist, where the type-writist presses against the
 table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,
 leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it
 farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest
 part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint
 of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon
 short sight and type-writing, which seemed to surprise her.”
 
 “It surprised me.”
 
 “But, surely, it was very obvious. I was then much surprised and
 interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she
 was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the
 one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one.
 One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the
 other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young
 lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,
 half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a
 hurry.”
 
 “And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my
 friend’s incisive reasoning.
 
 “I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home,
 but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was
 torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove
 and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry,
 and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the
 mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing,
 though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would
 you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”
 
 I held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said, “on
 the morning of the 14th, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About 5 ft. 7
 in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little
 bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and mustache; tinted
 glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in
 black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain,
 and gray Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided
 boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street.
 Anybody bringing,” etc., etc.
 
 “That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued,
 glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clew
 in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one
 remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”
 
 “They are type-written,” I remarked.
 
 “Not only that, but the signature is type-written. Look at the neat
 little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no
 superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The
 point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it
 conclusive.”
 
 “Of what?”
 
 “My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears
 upon the case?”
 
 “I cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be able to
 deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”
 
 “No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which
 should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the city, the other is
 to the young lady’s step-father, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he
 could meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well
 that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, doctor, we
 can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put
 our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.”
 
 I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of
 reasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt that he must
 have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanor with which he
 treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom.
 Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia
 and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird
 business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances
 connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange
 tangle indeed which he could not unravel.
 
 I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
 conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that
 he held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to the identity
 of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.
 
 A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at
 the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the
 sufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself
 free, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,
 half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_
 of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half
 asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his
 arm-chair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the
 pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent
 his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.
 
 “Well, have you solved it?” I asked, as I entered.
 
 “Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”
 
 “No, no, the mystery!” I cried.
 
 “Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There
 was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some
 of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no
 law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”
 
 “Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss
 Sutherland?”
 
 The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened
 his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and a
 tap at the door.
 
 “This is the girl’s step-father, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He
 has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”
 
 The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty
 years of age, clean shaven, and sallow skinned, with a bland,
 insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating
 gray eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny
 top hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the
 nearest chair.
 
 “Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this
 type-written letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with
 me for six o’clock?”
 
 “Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my
 own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you
 about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash
 linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she
 came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have
 noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her
 mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not
 connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a
 family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
 expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”
 
 “On the contrary,” said Holmes, quietly; “I have every reason to
 believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”
 
 Mr. Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves. “I am
 delighted to hear it,” he said.
 
 “It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a type-writer has
 really quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they
 are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get
 more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark
 in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some
 little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the
 ‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more
 obvious.”
 
 “We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no
 doubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at
 Holmes with his bright little eyes.
 
 “And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,
 Mr. Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little
 monograph some of these days on the type-writer and its relation to
 crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.
 I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.
 They are all type-written. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred
 and the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my
 magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I
 have alluded are there as well.”
 
 Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair, and picked up his hat. “I cannot
 waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If
 you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done
 it.”
 
 “Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the
 door. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”
 
 “What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips, and
 glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
 
 “Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes, suavely. “There is no
 possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,
 and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible
 for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down, and let
 us talk it over.”
 
 Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and a glitter
 of moisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.
 
 “I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
 Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty
 way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of
 events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.”
 
 The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
 breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on
 the corner of the mantel-piece, and, leaning back with his hands in his
 pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.
 
 “The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,”
 said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long
 as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their
 position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.
 It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good,
 amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so
 that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her
 little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her
 marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what
 does her step-father do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
 keeping her at home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people
 of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever.
 She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her
 positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever
 step-father do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head
 than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he
 disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked
 the face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear
 voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
 girl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other
 lovers by making love himself.”
 
 [Illustration: “GLANCING ABOUT HIM LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP”]
 
 “It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought
 that she would have been so carried away.”
 
 “Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
 decidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her
 step-father was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for
 an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s
 attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed
 admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was
 obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go,
 if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an
 engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from
 turning towards any one else. But the deception could not be kept up
 forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The
 thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a
 dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the
 young lady’s mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor
 for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a
 Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something
 happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished
 Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to
 his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen
 to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as
 he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
 of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler, and out at the other. I
 think that that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”
 
 Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had
 been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his
 pale face.
 
 “It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so
 very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are
 breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from
 the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself
 open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”
 
 “The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and
 throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved
 punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought
 to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing
 up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not
 part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I
 think I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the
 whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps
 upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we
 could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the
 road.
 
 “There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw
 himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from
 crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.
 The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”
 
 “I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.
 
 “Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer
 Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was
 equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident,
 as far as we could see, was the step-father. Then the fact that the
 two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when
 the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and
 the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy
 whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action
 in type-writing his signature, which, of course, inferred that his
 handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the
 smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with
 many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”
 
 “And how did you verify them?”
 
 “Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I
 knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
 description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result
 of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it
 to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it
 answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already
 noticed the peculiarities of the type-writer, and I wrote to the man
 himself at his business address, asking him if he would come here. As
 I expected, his reply was type-written, and revealed the same trivial
 but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
 Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description
 tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank.
 _Voila tout!_”
 
 “And Miss Sutherland?”
 
 “If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old
 Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and
 danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as
 much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”
 
 
 
 
 Adventure IV
 
 THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
 
 
 We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid
 brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes, and ran in this way:
 
 “Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from
 the West of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall
 be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave
 Paddington by the 11.15.”
 
 “What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “Will you
 go?”
 
 “I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.”
 
 “Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a
 little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you
 are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’s cases.”
 
 “I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one
 of them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I
 have only half an hour.”
 
 My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect
 of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and
 simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my
 valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing
 up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and
 taller by his long gray travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
 
 “It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It makes a
 considerable difference to me, having some one with me on whom I can
 thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.
 If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”
 
 We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers
 which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,
 with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past
 Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball, and
 tossed them up onto the rack.
 
 “Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.
 
 “Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”
 
 “The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just
 been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
 particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple
 cases which are so extremely difficult.”
 
 “That sounds a little paradoxical.”
 
 “But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clew.
 The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult is
 it to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a
 very serious case against the son of the murdered man.”
 
 “It is a murder, then?”
 
 “Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted
 until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will
 explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to
 understand it, in a very few words.
 
 “Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in
 Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John
 Turner, who made his money in Australia, and returned some years ago to
 the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was
 let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had
 known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that
 when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as
 possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his
 tenant, but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality,
 as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of
 eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither
 of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of
 the neighboring English families, and to have led retired lives, though
 both the McCarthys were fond of sport, and were frequently seen at
 the race-meetings of the neighborhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a
 man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen
 at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
 families. Now for the facts.
 
 “On June 3, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at
 Hatherley about three in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe
 Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the
 stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his
 serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he
 must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.
 From that appointment he never came back alive.
 
 “From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,
 and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old
 woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,
 a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose
 that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within
 a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.
 James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the
 best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and
 the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he
 heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
 
 “The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the
 game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly-wooded
 round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl
 of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of
 the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.
 She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood
 and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared
 to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using
 very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up
 his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
 violence that she ran away, and told her mother when she reached home
 that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and
 that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said
 the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say
 that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help
 of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his
 hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with
 fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out
 upon the grass beside the Pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
 blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might
 very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which
 was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under
 these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict
 of ‘Wilful Murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday,
 he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have
 referred the case to the next assizes. Those are the main facts of the
 case as they came out before the coroner and at the police-court.”
 
 “I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever
 circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”
 
 “Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes,
 thoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if
 you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing
 in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.
 It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave
 against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the
 culprit. There are several people in the neighborhood, however, and
 among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighboring land-owner,
 who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you
 may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the
 case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the
 case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying
 westward at fifty miles an hour, instead of quietly digesting their
 breakfasts at home.”
 
 “I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will
 find little credit to be gained out of this case.”
 
 “There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,
",Holmes
13," themselves. Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and
 you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the
 amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the
 distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher
 concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive,
 and impartial view of his own particular case.
 
 It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through
 a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured
 to halt beneath a low and dark archway. Having remained silent here,
 just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an
 exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an
 uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and
 rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.
 
 “What’s the matter?” inquired the Dodger.
 
 “Ha! ha! ha!” roared Charley Bates.
 
 “Hold your noise,” remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round.
 “Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?”
 
 “I can’t help it,” said Charley, “I can’t help it! To see him splitting
 away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up
 again’ the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as
 well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter
 him—oh, my eye!” The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the
 scene before him in too strong colours. As he arrived at this
 apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than
 before.
 
 “What’ll Fagin say?” inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next
 interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the
 question.
 
 “What?” repeated Charley Bates.
 
 “Ah, what?” said the Dodger.
 
 “Why, what should he say?” inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly
 in his merriment; for the Dodger’s manner was impressive. “What should
 he say?”
 
 Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat,
 scratched his head, and nodded thrice.
 
 “What do you mean?” said Charley.
 
 “Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn’t, and high
 cockolorum,” said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual
 countenance.
 
 This was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so;
 and again said, “What do you mean?”
 
 The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering
 the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue
 into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in
 a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down
 the court. Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.
 
 The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the
 occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he
 sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a
 pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a
 rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking
 sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the
 door, and listened.
 
 “Why, how’s this?” muttered the Jew: changing countenance; “only two of
 ’em? Where’s the third? They can’t have got into trouble. Hark!”
 
 The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was
 slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it
 behind them.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XIII.
 SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER,
 CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING
 TO THIS HISTORY
 
 
 “Where’s Oliver?” said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. “Where’s
 the boy?”
 
 The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his
 violence; and looked uneasily at each other. But they made no reply.
 
 “What’s become of the boy?” said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by
 the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations. “Speak out,
 or I’ll throttle you!”
 
 Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who
 deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who
 conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be
 throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud,
 well-sustained, and continuous roar—something between a mad bull and a
 speaking trumpet.
 
 “Will you speak?” thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that
 his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.
 
 “Why, the traps have got him, and that’s all about it,” said the
 Dodger, sullenly. “Come, let go o’ me, will you!” And, swinging
 himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the
 Jew’s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass
 at the merry old gentleman’s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect,
 would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily
 replaced.
 
 The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could
 have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and,
 seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant’s head. But
 Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly
 terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full
 at that young gentleman.
 
 “Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!” growled a deep voice. “Who
 pitched that ’ere at me? It’s well it’s the beer, and not the pot, as
 hit me, or I’d have settled somebody. I might have know’d, as nobody
 but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to
 throw away any drink but water—and not that, unless he done the River
 Company every quarter. Wot’s it all about, Fagin? D—me, if my
 neck-handkercher an’t lined with beer! Come in, you sneaking warmint;
 wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master!
 Come in!”
 
 The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of
 about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab
 breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed
 a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;—the kind of legs,
 which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete
 state without a set of fetters to garnish them. He had a brown hat on
 his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the
 long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he
 spoke. He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance
 with a beard of three days’ growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which
 displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently
 damaged by a blow.
 
 “Come in, d’ye hear?” growled this engaging ruffian.
 
 A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty
 different places, skulked into the room.
 
 “Why didn’t you come in afore?” said the man. “You’re getting too proud
 to own me afore company, are you? Lie down!”
 
 This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the
 other end of the room. He appeared well used to it, however; for he
 coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound,
 and winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute,
 appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment.
 
 “What are you up to? Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious,
 in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?” said the man, seating himself deliberately.
 “I wonder they don’t murder you! I would if I was them. If I’d been
 your ’prentice, I’d have done it long ago, and—no, I couldn’t have sold
 you afterwards, for you’re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity
 of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don’t blow glass
 bottles large enough.”
 
 “Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes,” said the Jew, trembling; “don’t speak so
 loud!”
 
 “None of your mistering,” replied the ruffian; “you always mean
 mischief when you come that. You know my name: out with it! I shan’t
 disgrace it when the time comes.”
 
 “Well, well, then—Bill Sikes,” said the Jew, with abject humility. “You
 seem out of humour, Bill.”
 
 “Perhaps I am,” replied Sikes; “I should think you was rather out of
 sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots
 about, as you do when you blab and—”
 
 “Are you mad?” said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and
 pointing towards the boys.
 
 Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left
 ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb
 show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly. He then, in cant
 terms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled,
 but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here,
 demanded a glass of liquor.
 
 “And mind you don’t poison it,” said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the
 table.
 
 This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer
 with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard,
 he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish
 (at all events) to improve upon the distiller’s ingenuity not very far
 from the old gentleman’s merry heart.
 
 After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes
 condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious
 act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver’s
 capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and
 improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable
 under the circumstances.
 
 “I’m afraid,” said the Jew, “that he may say something which will get
 us into trouble.”
 
 “That’s very likely,” returned Sikes with a malicious grin. “You’re
 blowed upon, Fagin.”
 
 “And I’m afraid, you see,” added the Jew, speaking as if he had not
 noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did
 so,—“I’m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a
 good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it
 would for me, my dear.”
 
 The man started, and turned round upon the Jew. But the old gentleman’s
 shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly
 staring on the opposite wall.
 
 There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie
 appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by
 a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an
 attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter
 in the streets when he went out.
 
 “Somebody must find out wot’s been done at the office,” said Mr. Sikes
 in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.
 
 The Jew nodded assent.
 
 “If he hasn’t peached, and is committed, there’s no fear till he comes
 out again,” said Mr. Sikes, “and then he must be taken care on. You
 must get hold of him somehow.”
 
 Again the Jew nodded.
 
 The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but,
 unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being
 adopted. This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and
 Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and
 deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or
 pretext whatever.
 
 How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of
 uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to
 guess. It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however;
 for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on
 a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.
 
 “The very thing!” said the Jew. “Bet will go; won’t you, my dear?”
 
 “Wheres?” inquired the young lady.
 
 “Only just up to the office, my dear,” said the Jew coaxingly.
 
 It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm
 that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and
 earnest desire to be “blessed” if she would; a polite and delicate
 evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been
 possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict
 upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.
 
 The Jew’s countenance fell. He turned from this young lady, who was
 gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and
 yellow curl-papers, to the other female.
 
 “Nancy, my dear,” said the Jew in a soothing manner, “what do _you_
 say?”
 
 “That it won’t do; so it’s no use a-trying it on, Fagin,” replied
 Nancy.
 
 “What do you mean by that?” said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly
 manner.
 
 “What I say, Bill,” replied the lady collectedly.
 
 “Why, you’re just the very person for it,” reasoned Mr. Sikes: “nobody
 about here knows anything of you.”
 
 “And as I don’t want ’em to, neither,” replied Nancy in the same
 composed manner, “it’s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.”
 
 “She’ll go, Fagin,” said Sikes.
 
 “No, she won’t, Fagin,” said Nancy.
 
 “Yes, she will, Fagin,” said Sikes.
 
 And Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises, and
 bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake
 the commission. She was not, indeed, withheld by the same
 considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed
 into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb
 of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being
 recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.
 
 Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her
 curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,—both articles of dress
 being provided from the Jew’s inexhaustible stock,—Miss Nancy prepared
 to issue forth on her errand.
 
 “Stop a minute, my dear,” said the Jew, producing, a little covered
 basket. “Carry that in one hand. It looks more respectable, my dear.”
 
 “Give her a door-key to carry in her t’other one, Fagin,” said Sikes;
 “it looks real and genivine like.”
 
 “Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,” said the Jew, hanging a large
 street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady’s right hand.
 
 “There; very good! Very good indeed, my dear!” said the Jew, rubbing
 his hands.
 
 “Oh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!”
 exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket
 and the street-door key in an agony of distress. “What has become of
 him! Where have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what’s
 been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please,
 gentlemen!”
 
 Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone:
 to the immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked
 to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.
 
 “Ah, she’s a clever girl, my dears,” said the Jew, turning round to his
 young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition
 to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.
 
 “She’s a honour to her sex,” said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and
 smiting the table with his enormous fist. “Here’s her health, and
 wishing they was all like her!”
 
 While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the
 accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the
 police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity
 consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she
 arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.
 
 Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the
 cell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and
 listened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke.
 
 “Nolly, dear?” murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; “Nolly?”
 
 There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been
 taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society
 having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr.
 Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and
 amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be
 more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical
 instrument. He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the
 loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the
 county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.
 
 “Well!” cried a faint and feeble voice.
 
 “Is there a little boy here?” inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.
 
 “No,” replied the voice; “God forbid.”
 
 This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for _not_
 playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and
 doing nothing for his livelihood. In the next cell was another man, who
 was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license;
 thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the
 Stamp-office.
 
 But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or
 knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in
 the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and
 lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of
 the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear
 brother.
 
 “I haven’t got him, my dear,” said the old man.
 
 “Where is he?” screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.
 
 “Why, the gentleman’s got him,” replied the officer.
 
 “What gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?” exclaimed
 Nancy.
 
 In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the
 deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office,
 and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to
 have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the
 prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own
 residence: of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it
 was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in
 the directions to the coachman.
 
 In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman
 staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a
 swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could
 think of, to the domicile of the Jew.
 
 Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered,
 than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat,
 expeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of
 wishing the company good-morning.
 
 “We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,” said the Jew
 greatly excited. “Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring
 home some news of him! Nancy, my dear, I must have him found. I trust
 to you, my dear,—to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,”
 added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; “there’s money,
 my dears. I shall shut up this shop to-night. You’ll know where to find
 me! Don’t stop here a minute. Not an instant, my dears!”
 
 With these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully
 double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of
 concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.
 Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath
 his clothing.
 
 A rap at the door startled him in this occupation. “Who’s there?” he
 cried in a shrill tone.
 
 “Me!” replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.
 
 “What now?” cried the Jew impatiently.
 
 “Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?” inquired the
 Dodger.
 
 “Yes,” replied the Jew, “wherever she lays hands on him. Find him, find
 him out, that’s all. I shall know what to do next; never fear.”
 
 The boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after
 his companions.
 
 “He has not peached so far,” said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.
 “If he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth
 yet.”
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XIV.
 COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER’S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW’S, WITH
 THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM,
 WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND
 
 
 Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow’s
 abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was
 carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the
 conversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver’s
 history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse
 without exciting him. He was still too weak to get up to breakfast;
 but, when he came down into the housekeeper’s room next day, his first
 act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again
 looking on the face of the beautiful lady. His expectations were
 disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.
 
 “Ah!” said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver’s eyes.
 “It is gone, you see.”
 
 “I see it is ma’am,” replied Oliver. “Why have they taken it away?”
 
 “It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it
 seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you
 know,” rejoined the old lady.
 
 “Oh, no, indeed. It didn’t worry me, ma’am,” said Oliver. “I liked to
 see it. I quite loved it.”
 
 “Well, well!” said the old lady, good-humouredly; “you get well as fast
 as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There! I promise
 you that! Now, let us talk about something else.”
 
 This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at
 that time. As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he
 endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened
 attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and
 handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome
 man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a
 merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man,
 and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought
 the tears into her eyes to talk about them. When the old lady had
 expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the
 merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone,
 poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.
 After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as
 quickly as she could teach: and at which game they played, with great
 interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some
 warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily
 to bed.
 
 They were happy days, those of Oliver’s recovery. Everything was so
 quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after
 the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it
 seemed like Heaven itself. He was no sooner strong enough to put his
 clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and
 a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him. As Oliver
 was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave
 them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell
 them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself. This she very readily
 did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew
 roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think
 that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger
 of his ever being able to wear them again. They were sad rags, to tell
 the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.
 
 One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was
 sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.
 Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see
 him in his study, and talk to him a little while.
 
 “Bless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair
 nicely for you, child,” said Mrs. Bedwin. “Dear heart alive! If we had
 known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar
 on, and made you as smart as sixpence!”
 
 Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented
 grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little
 frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and
 handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so
 far as to say: looking at him with great complacency from head to foot,
 that she really didn’t think it would have been possible, on the
 longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.
 
 Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. On Mr. Brownlow
 calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room,
 quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little
 gardens. There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr.
 Brownlow was seated reading. When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book
 away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.
 Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read
 such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world
 wiser. Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver
 Twist, every day of their lives.
 
 “There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?” said Mr.
 Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the
 shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.
 
 “A great number, sir,” replied Oliver. “I never saw so many.”
 
 “You shall read them, if you behave well,” said the old gentleman
 kindly; “and you will like that, better than looking at the
 outsides,—that is, some cases; because there are books of which the
 backs and covers are by far the best parts.”
 
 “I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,” said Oliver, pointing to
 some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.
 
 “Not always those,” said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head,
 and smiling as he did so; “there are other equally heavy ones, though
 of a much smaller size. How should you like to grow up a clever man,
 and write books, eh?”
 
 “I think I would rather read them, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “What! wouldn’t you like to be a book-writer?” said the old gentleman.
 
 Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it
 would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old
 gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.
 Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it
 was.
 
 “Well, well,” said the old gentleman, composing his features. “Don’t be
 afraid! We won’t make an author of you, while there’s an honest trade
 to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.”
 
 “Thank you, sir,” said Oliver. At the earnest manner of his reply, the
 old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious
 instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention
 to.
 
 “Now,” said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the
 same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him
 assume yet, “I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am
 going to say. I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am
 sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would
 be.”
 
 “Oh, don’t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!” exclaimed
 Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman’s
 commencement! “Don’t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets
 again. Let me stay here, and be a servant. Don’t send me back to the
 wretched place I came from. Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!”
 
 “My dear child,” said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of
 Oliver’s sudden appeal; “you need not be afraid of my deserting you,
 unless you give me cause.”
 
 “I never, never will, sir,” interposed Oliver.
 
 “I hope not,” rejoined the old gentleman. “I do not think you ever
 will. I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have
 endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you,
 nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well
 account for, even to myself. The persons on whom I have bestowed my
 dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and
 delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my
 heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections. Deep
 affliction has but strengthened and refined them.”
 
 As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to
 his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards:
 Oliver sat quite still.
 
 “Well, well!” said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful
 tone, “I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing
 that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful,
 perhaps, not to wound me again. You say you are an orphan, without a
 friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make,
 confirm the statement. Let me hear your story; where you come from; who
 brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you.
 Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.”
 
 Oliver’s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on
 the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the
 farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly
 impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door: and the
 servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.
 
 “Is he coming up?” inquired Mr. Brownlow.
 
 “Yes, sir,” replied the servant. “He asked if there were any muffins in
 the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.”
 
 Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was
 an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in
 his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason
 to know.
 
 “Shall I go downstairs, sir?” inquired Oliver.
 
 “No,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “I would rather you remained here.”
 
 At this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a
 thick stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was
 dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and
 gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with
 green. A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat;
 and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end,
 dangled loosely below it. The ends of his white neckerchief were
 twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes
 into which his countenance was twisted, defy description. He had a
 manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking
 out of the corners of his eyes at the same time: which irresistibly
 reminded the beholder of a parrot. In this attitude, he fixed himself,
 the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of
 orange-peel at arm’s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented
 voice.
 
 “Look here! do you see this! Isn’t it a most wonderful and
 extraordinary thing that I can’t call at a man’s house but I find a
 piece of this poor surgeon’s friend on the staircase? I’ve been lamed
 with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I’ll
 be content to eat my own head, sir!”
 
 This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed
 nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his
 case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility
 of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable
 a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,
 Mr. Grimwig’s head was such a particularly large one, that the most
 sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get
 through it at a sitting—to put entirely out of the question, a very
 thick coating of powder.
 
 “I’ll eat my head, sir,” repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon
 the ground. “Hallo! what’s that!” looking at Oliver, and retreating a
 pace or two.
 
 “This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,” said Mr.
 Brownlow.
 
 Oliver bowed.
 
 “You don’t mean to say that’s the boy who had the fever, I hope?” said
 Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more. “Wait a minute! Don’t speak!
 Stop—” continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever
 in his triumph at the discovery; “that’s the boy who had the orange! If
 that’s not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel
 upon the staircase, I’ll eat my head, and his too.”
 
 “No, no, he has not had one,” said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. “Come! Put
 down your hat; and speak to my young friend.”
 
 “I feel strongly on this subject, sir,” said the irritable old
 gentleman, drawing off his gloves. “There’s always more or less
 orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it’s put there
 by the surgeon’s boy at the corner. A young woman stumbled over a bit
 last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I
 saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.
 ‘Don’t go to him,’ I called out of the window, ‘he’s an assassin! A
 man-trap!’ So he is. If he is not—” Here the irascible old gentleman
 gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always
 understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it
 was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick in his hand,
 he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached to
 a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing that he was
 the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.
 
 “That’s the boy, is it?” said Mr. Grimwig, at length.
 
 “That’s the boy,” replied Mr. Brownlow.
 
 “How are you, boy?” said Mr. Grimwig.
 
 “A great deal better, thank you, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about
 to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell
 Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the
 visitor’s manner, he was very happy to do.
 
 “He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?” inquired Mr. Brownlow.
 
 “I don’t know,” replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.
 
 “Don’t know?”
 
 “No. I don’t know. I never see any difference in boys. I only knew two
 sort of boys. Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.”
 
 “And which is Oliver?”
 
 “Mealy. I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call
 him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy;
 with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of
 his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a
 wolf. I know him! The wretch!”
 
 “Come,” said Mr. Brownlow, “these are not the characteristics of young
 Oliver Twist; so he needn’t excite your wrath.”
 
 “They are not,” replied Mr. Grimwig. “He may have worse.”
 
 Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.
 Grimwig the most exquisite delight.
 
 “He may have worse, I say,” repeated Mr. Grimwig. “Where does he come
 from! Who is he? What is he? He has had a fever. What of that? Fevers
 are not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers
 sometimes; haven’t they, eh? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for
 murdering his master. He had had a fever six times; he wasn’t
 recommended to mercy on that account. Pooh! nonsense!”
 
 Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.
 Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver’s appearance and
 manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for
 contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the
 orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to
 him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the
 first, to oppose his friend. When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one
 point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he
 had postponed any investigation into Oliver’s previous history until he
 thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled
 maliciously. And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was
 in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn’t find
 a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be
 content to—and so forth.
 
 All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous
 gentleman: knowing his friend’s peculiarities, bore with great good
 humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his
 entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and
 Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than
 he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman’s presence.
 
 “And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of
 the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?” asked Grimwig of Mr.
 Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as
 he resumed his subject.
 
 “To-morrow morning,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “I would rather he was alone
 with me at the time. Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o’clock, my
 dear.”
 
 “Yes, sir,” replied Oliver. He answered with some hesitation, because
 he was confused by Mr. Grimwig’s looking so hard at him.
 
 “I’ll tell you what,” whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; “he
 won’t come up to you to-morrow morning. I saw him hesitate. He is
 deceiving you, my good friend.”
 
 “I’ll swear he is not,” replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.
 
 “If he is not,” said Mr. Grimwig, “I’ll—” and down went the stick.
 
 “I’ll answer for that boy’s truth with my life!” said Mr. Brownlow,
 knocking the table.
 
 “And I for his falsehood with my head!” rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking
 the table also.
 
 “We shall see,” said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.
 
 “We will,” replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; “we will.”
 
 As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment,
 a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased
 of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this
 history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.
 
 “Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!” said Mr. Brownlow; “there is something to
 go back.”
 
 “He has gone, sir,” replied Mrs. Bedwin.
 
 “Call after him,” said Mr. Brownlow; “it’s particular. He is a poor
 man, and they are not paid for. There are some books to be taken back,
 too.”
 
 The street-door was opened. Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran
 another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy;
 but there was no boy in sight. Oliver and the girl returned, in a
 breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.
 
 “Dear me, I am very sorry for that,” exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; “I
 particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.”
 
 “Send Oliver with them,” said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; “he
 will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.”
 
 “Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,” said Oliver. “I’ll run
 all the way, sir.”
 
 The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out
 on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined
 him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the
 commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on
 this head at least: at once.
 
 “You _shall_ go, my dear,” said the old gentleman. “The books are on a
 chair by my table. Fetch them down.”
 
 Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in
 a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to
 take.
 
 “You are to say,” said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; “you
 are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have
 come to pay the four pound ten I owe him. This is a five-pound note, so
 you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.”
 
 “I won’t be ten minutes, sir,” said Oliver, eagerly. Having buttoned up
 the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully
 under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room. Mrs. Bedwin
 followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions about the
 nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the
 street: all of which Oliver said he clearly understood. Having
 superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady
 at length permitted him to depart.
 
 “Bless his sweet face!” said the old lady, looking after him. “I can’t
 bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.”
 
 At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned
 the corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and,
 closing the door, went back to her own room.
 
 “Let me see; he’ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,” said Mr.
 Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table. “It will
 be dark by that time.”
 
 “Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?” inquired Mr. Grimwig.
 
 “Don’t you?” asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.
 
 The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig’s breast, at the
 moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend’s confident smile.
 
 “No,” he said, smiting the table with his fist, “I do not. The boy has
 a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his
 arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket. He’ll join his old friends
 the thieves, and laugh at you. If ever that boy returns to this house,
 sir, I’ll eat my head.”
 
 With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the
 two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.
 
 It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our
 own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and
 hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a
 bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see
 his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly
 and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come
 back.
 
 It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely
 discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in
 silence, with the watch between them.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XV.
 SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY
 WERE
 
 
 In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of
 Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light
 burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in
 the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a
 small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a
 velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by
 that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated
 to recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet, sat a white-coated,
 red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his
 master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh
 cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some
 recent conflict.
 
 “Keep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!” said Mr. Sikes, suddenly
 breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be
 disturbed by the dog’s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought
 upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable
 from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for
 argument and consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a
 kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.
 
 Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by
 their masters; but Mr. Sikes’s dog, having faults of temper in common
 with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a
 powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth
 in one of the half-boots. Having given in a hearty shake, he retired,
 growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr.
 Sikes levelled at his head.
 
 “You would, would you?” said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and
 deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew
 from his pocket. “Come here, you born devil! Come here! D’ye hear?”
 
 The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest
 key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some
 unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he
 was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping
 the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild
 beast.
 
 This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on
 his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped
 from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and
 barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the
 struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the
 door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the
 poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.
 
 There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. Mr.
 Sikes, being disappointed of the dog’s participation, at once
 transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.
 
 “What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?” said Sikes,
 with a fierce gesture.
 
",OliverTwist
14,"   I don’t know; but that is the hero of whom he reminds me. I met him
   at a literary garden party to which I was bidden after “The
   Immoralists” had been so favourably reviewed. It was given by a lady
   who seemed to know everybody and like no one, a keen two-bladed
   tongue leapt out among her guests, scarifying them. She told me Mr.
   Rosenstein was not only a publisher but an amorist. He looked
   curiously unlike it; but an introduction and a short interview
   turned me sceptic of my own impression, inclined me to the belief in
   hers.
 
   I have wandered from my theme—your kindness, my nervousness. I
   shall try to do credit to your penetration. You said that you were
   sure I should make a success of anything I undertook! I wonder if
   you were right. And if my Staffordshire book will prove you so? I
   am going to try and make it interesting, not too technical! But my
   intentions vary all the time. A preliminary chapter on clays was
   in my first scheme, I now want instead to tell of the family
   history of half a dozen potters. From this I begin to dream of
   stories of the figures; the short-waisted husband and wife
   a-marketing with their basket of fruit and vegetables, the
   clergyman in the tithe piece, a benignant villain this, with a
   chucking-his-parishioners-under-the-chin expression. Dear Mr.
   Stanton, what will happen if it turns out that I cannot write a
   monograph, but am only a novelist? You said I could trust you to
   act as Editor and blue-pencil my redundancies. But what if it
   should be all redundancy? Put something about this in the
   agreement, will you? I want to make money, but not at your
   expense. I _am_ nervous. I fear that instead of a book on
   Staffordshire Pottery I shall give you an illustrated volume of
   short stories published at five guineas!! What an outcry from the
   press! Already I have been called “precious.” Now they will talk
   of “pretentiousness”; the “grand manner” without the grand brain
   behind it! Will you really help and advise me? I have never felt
   less self-confident.
 
                                              Yours sincerely,
                                                        MARGARET CAPEL.

   _Dear Mrs. Capel_:—
 
   As we arranged at our interview yesterday I now enclose a draft
   contract for the book.
 
   If there is any point not entirely clear to you please do not
   hesitate to tell me, and I shall be glad also of any suggestion or
   criticism that may occur to you in regard to possible alteration of
   the various clauses, and will do my best to meet your wishes. For I
   am more than anxious that we shall begin what I hope will prove a
   long and successful “partnership” with complete understanding and
   confidence.
 
   Further enquiry makes me sanguine that the scheme is a good one, and
   we will do everything we can to produce a beautiful book.
 
   May I say that it was a great pleasure and privilege to me to meet
   you here yesterday? I hope the interest you will find in this
   present work will afford you some relief during this time of trouble
   and anxiety you are passing through; and counteract to some extent
   at least the pettiness and publicity of litigation. I only refer to
   this with the greatest respect and sympathy.
 
   There are many details, not only of the contract, but for the plan
   of the book, which we could certainly best arrange if we discussed
   them, rather than by writing.
 
   Could you make it convenient to lunch with me one day next week? I
   shall be in the West End on Wednesday, and suggest the Café Royal at
   two o’clock.
 
   It would be good of you to meet me there.
 
                                             Yours sincerely,
                                                       GABRIEL STANTON.

   _Dear Mr. Stanton_:—
 
   Our letters crossed. Thanks for yours with agreement. The greater
   part seems to me to be merely technical, and I have no observations
   to make about it.
 
   Par. 2: guaranteeing that the work is in no way “a violation of any
   existing copyright,” etc. I think this is your concern rather than
   mine. You say there is a book existing on Staffordshire Pottery,
   perhaps you can get me a copy, and then I can see that ours shall be
   entirely different.
 
   Par. 7: beginning “accounts to be made up annually,” etc., seems to
   give you an exceptionally long time to pay me anything that may be
   due. But perhaps I misunderstand it.
 
   Therefore, and perhaps for other reasons, I very gladly accept your
   kind invitation to lunch with you on Wednesday at the Café Royal,
   and will be there at two, bringing the agreement with me.
 
                            With kind regards,
                                          Yours very truly,

   _Dear Mrs. Capel_:—
 
   I am breaking into the commonplace routine of a particularly
   tiresome business day, to give myself the pleasure of writing to
   you, and you will forgive me if I purposely avoid business—for
   indeed it seems to me today that life might be so pleasant without
   work. That little grumble has done me good. I want to say what I
   fear I did not express to you yesterday—how greatly I enjoyed our
   talk. It was good of you to come and more good of you to tell me
   something of your present difficulties. I wish I could have been
   more helpful—but please believe I am more sympathetic than I was
   able to let you know, and I do understand much of what must be
   trying and unhappy for you during these weeks. Counsels of
   perfection are poor comfort, but perhaps that some one is most
   genuinely in accord with you—and anxious to help in any way
   possible—may be of some little value.
 
   I beg you to believe that this is so, and I should welcome the
   chance of being of any service to you. This all reads very formal I
   fear, but your kindness must interpret the spirit rather than the
   letter.
 
   Last evening I went into an old curiosity shop to try and find a
   wedding-present for a niece who is also my god-daughter, and I
   secured six beautiful Chippendale chairs. Curiously enough the man
   showed me what he said was the best specimen of Staffordshire he had
   ever had. A group of musicians—seeming to my inexperienced eye good
   in colour and design. I know not what impulse persuaded me to buy
   the piece. Today I am fearing that my purchase is not genuine. May I
   bring it to you on Sunday for approval or condemnation? Don’t
   trouble to answer if you will be at home—I will call at five
   o’clock.
 
   Now I must return to less pleasant business affairs—the telephone is
   insistent.
 
                                         Yours very sincerely,

   _Dear Mr. Stanton_:—
 
   Thank you so much for your kind letter, it made a charming savoury
   to that little luncheon you ordered. Did I tell you how much I
   enjoyed it? If not, please understand I am doing so now. The
   _mousse_ was a dream of delight, the roses were very helpful. I have
   a theory about flowers and food, and how to blend them. Which
   reminds me that my father wants to share with me in the pleasure of
   your acquaintance and bids me ask if you will dine with us on the
   24th at eight o’clock. This of course must not prevent your coming
   Sunday afternoon with your pottery “find.” I am more than curious, I
   am devoured with curiosity to see it. I don’t know a Staffordshire
   “group of musicians,” it sounds like Chelsea! Bring it by all means,
   but if it is Staffordshire and not in my collection, I warn you I
   shall at once begin bargaining with you, spending my royalties in
   advance! Yes! I think I hate business too, as you say, and should
   like to avoid it. We were fairly successful, by the way, in the Café
   Royal! Our talk ranged over a large field, became rather personal—I
   think I spoke too freely; it must have been the Steinberger! or
   because I am really very worried and depressed. Depression is the
   old age of the emotions, and garrulousness its distressing symptom.
 
                                              Yours sincerely,

   _Dear Mrs. Capel_:—
 
   I am so glad to have your letter and look forward to Sunday. Should
   my little pottery “find” prove authentic I have no doubt we can
   arrange for its transfer to you, on business or even un-business
   lines!
 
   I accept with pleasure your invitation to dinner on the 24th. I have
   heard often of your father from my friend Wilfrid Henning, who
   attends to what little investments I make—and who meets your father
   in connection with that big Newfoundland scheme for connecting the
   traffic from the Eastern ports to Lake Ontario. I should value the
   opportunity to hear of it, first hand.

   _Dear Mr. Stanton_:—
 
   I am no longer puzzled about the “musicians”; it is Staffordshire, I
   was convinced of that from the first but had to confirm my
   impression. I will tell you all about it when we meet again (on the
   24th), I am sure you will be interested. I want you to let me have
   it. Whatever you paid for it I will give you, and any profit you
   like. I won’t bargain with you, but I really feel I can never part
   with it again. It was a wonderful chance that you should find it.
   Wasn’t Sunday altogether strange? Such a crowd, and so difficult to
   talk. I shall have to get out of London, I have a sense of fatigue
   all the time, of restless incoherent fear. I dread sympathy, and
   scent curiosity as if it were carrion. In that little talk I had
   among the tea-things I said none of the things I meant. I believe
   you understood this, although you only said yes, and yes again to my
   wildest suggestions. I am only epigrammatic when I am shy; it is the
   form taken by my mental stammer. Epigrams come to me too, when I
   have a scene in my head too big to write. I find my hand shaking,
   heart beating, tremulous. Then my queer brain relieves the pressure
   on my feelings and stammers out my scene in short cryptic sentences.
   That is why, although I am an emotional thinker, I am what you are
   pleased to call an intellectual writer.
 
   And now for the agreement, in which I have ventured to make
   alterations, and even additions. Will you return it to me with
   comments if you think I have been too difficult or exacting. My
   father tells me I have inherited his business ability. He means to
   pay me a compliment, but I gather your point of view is that
   business ability is but deformity in an intellectual woman? I’m
   sorry for this deformity of mine, realising the unfavourable
   impression it may create. Try and forgive me for it, won’t you? You
   need not even remember it when you are telling me what I am to give
   you for the Staffordshire piece!
 
                              With kind regards,
                                          Yours very sincerely,

   _Dear Mrs. Capel_:—
 
   What good news about the little “Staffordshire” piece! I am really
   delighted. Please don’t mar my pleasure in thinking of it happily
   housed with you by questions of price or bargaining. Rather add to
   my pride in my “find” by accepting it as a small recognition of my
   great good fortune in having made your acquaintance.
 
   Out of the chatter and clatter of the tea on Sunday the things you
   said remain with me; if they were epigrams they were vivid and to me
   very real.
 
   I hated everything that interrupted—and hated going away. Quite
   humbly I say that I think I did understand, and was longing to tell
   you so. But I have never had the tongue of a ready speaker, and as I
   left your beautiful home I was choked with unspoken words a cleverer
   man would have found more quickly.
 
   How much I wished I could have expressed myself. I wanted to say
   that I had no hateful curiosity, but only an overwhelming sympathy
   and desire for your confidence, a bedrock craving for your
   friendship. May I be your friend? May I? Or am I presuming on your
   kindness and too short an acquaintanceship?
 
   Anyhow, I can’t write on business, the contract is to go through
   with all your alterations.
 
   Looking forward to the 24th, I need only sign,
 
                                       Au revoir,

   _Dear Mr. Stanton_:—
 
   I don’t know what to say about “The Musicians,” that is why I have
   not already written to say it! I have not put the group into my
   collection, it is on my bedroom mantelpiece. I see it when I first
   wake in the morning, it is the last thing upon which my tired eyes
   rest before I turn off the light at night. Sometimes I think those
   musicians are playing the prelude to the friendship of which you
   speak.
 
   I wonder why you are so curiously sympathetic to me, and why I mind
   so little admitting it. Friendship has been rare in my life. You
   offer me yours, and I am on the point of accepting it; thinking all
   the time what it may mean, what I can give you in return. An hour
   now and again of detached talk, a great deal of trouble with my
   literary affairs ... there is not much in that for you; is there?
   Are the Musicians really a gift? They must go on playing to me
   softly then, and the prelude be slow and long-drawn-out. I am afraid
   even of friendship, that is the truth. I’m disillusioned,
   disappointed, tired. Nothing has ever happened to me as I meant it.
   When I first came from America with my father, I was full of the
   wildest hopes, and now I have outlived them all. It is not an
   affectation, it is a profound truth, and at twenty-eight I find
   myself worn out, dimmed, exhausted. I have had fame (a small measure
   of it, but enough for comparison), wealth, and that horrid
   nightmare, love.
 
   My father spoiled me when I was small, believed too much in me.
   He thought me a genius, and I ... perhaps I thought so too. I
   puzzled and perplexed him, and he felt overweighted with his
   responsibilities, with character-studying an egotistic girl of
   sixteen. The result was a stepmother. Can you imagine what I
   suffered! She began almost immediately to suffocate me with her
   kindness. She too admitted I was a genius. Do you know we had
   the idea, these besotted parents of mine and I, that I was to be
   a great pianist! I practised many hours a day, sustained by
   jellies, and beef-tea and encouragement. I had the best
   teachers, a few weeks in Dresden with Lentheric, my father
   poured out his money like water. The end of that period was a
   prolonged fainting fit, the first of many, the discovery I had a
   weak heart, that the exertion of piano-playing affected it
   unfavourably. I came back from Dresden at eighteen, was
   presented the same year, the papers said I was beautiful; father
   put himself out of the way to be nice to pressmen; he had
   acquired the habit in America whilst he was building up his
   fortune. That I was accounted beautiful and could play Chopin
   and was to have a fortune, made me appear also brilliant. My
   father paid for the printing of my first book. My first one-act
   play was performed at a West End theatre. Then I met James
   Capel. Mr. Justice Jeune knows the story of my married life
   better than any one else. I was high-spirited before it began.
   At the end of a year I was physically, mentally, morally a
   wreck. I don’t know which of us hated the other more, my husband
   or I. Anyway, he made no objection to my returning to my father.
   My stepmother’s suffocating kindness descended upon me again,
   and now I found it healing. When I was healed I wrote “The
   Immoralists.” Then my father’s pride in me revived. He and my
   stepmother kept open house and collected celebrities to show the
   dimness of their light as a background for my supposed more
   brilliant shining! Society was pleased to come, my father
   growing always richer.... I wrote “The Farce of Fearlessness”
   and “Love and the Lutist” about this time, and my other play.
   When my husband made it imperative by his proved and public
   blackguardism I resorted to the law, and acting under advice,
   fought him in the arena he chose, and have now won my freedom,
   but at an incredible, hardly yet to be realised cost, all my
   wounds exposed in the market-place.
 
   I wonder why I am recapitulating all this. I think it is to show you
   I am in no mood for friendship. There are times when I am savage
   with pain, and times when I am exhausted from it, times when I feel
   bruised all over, so tender that the touch of a word brings tears,
   times when my overwhelming pity for myself leaves me incapable of
   realizing anything beyond my wrongs. I say I have won my freedom,
   but even this is untrue: at present I have only won six months of
   probation, during which I am still James Capel’s wife. Sometimes I
   think I shall never live through them, the stain of my connection
   with him is like mortification.
 
   The prelude played by the Musicians is a prelude to a dream.
 
   And still I am grateful you gave them to me.
 
                                              Yours very truly,
                                                        MARGARET CAPEL.
 
 When I had read as far as this the codein exerted its influence. My
 eyelids drooped, I slept and recovered myself. The sense of what I was
 reading began to escape, I knew it was time to put the bundle away.
 There were not very many more letters. I put all the papers on the table
 by my side, then dropped off. Margaret betrayed herself completely in
 her letters. Gabriel Stanton was still a strange unrealisable figure.
 
 
 
 
                                CHAPTER V
 
 
 The few words I had with Nurse Benham the next morning cleared the air
 and the situation between us. The strange thing was that at first she
 did not notice the parcel at all, still loose and untidy in the paper in
 which Dr. Kennedy had enwrapped it. Not until I told her to be careful
 not to spill the tea over it did it strike her to wonder how it came
 there.
 
 “Did Suzanne give you that?” she asked suspiciously.
 
 “She has not been in my room since you left me.”
 
 “That’s the very parcel you asked for the other night. How ever did you
 get hold of it?”
 
 “After you left me I got out of bed and fetched it.”
 
 “You got out of bed!” She grew red in the face with rage or incredulity.
 
 “Yes, twice. Once for the parcel and once for the scissors!”
 
 She did not speak at once, standing there with her flushed face. So I
 went on:
 
 “It is absurd for you to insist on me doing this or that, or leaving it
 undone. You are here to take care of me, not to bully and tyrannise over
 me.”
 
 “I am no good to you at all. I’d better go. You _will_ take matters into
 your own hands. I never knew such a patient, never. One would think
 you’d no sense at all, that you didn’t know how ill you were.”
 
 “That is no reason why I should not be allowed to get better. Believe
 me, the only way for that to come about is that I should be allowed to
 lead my own life in my own way.”
 
 “To get up in the middle of the night with the window wide open, to walk
 about the room in your nightgown!”
 
 “I should not have done so, you know, if you had passed me the things
 when I asked you for them.”
 
 “You don’t want a nurse at all,” she repeated.
 
 “Yes, I do. What I don’t want is a gaoler.”
 
 I was on the sofa when Dr. Kennedy called, the papers on the table
 beside me. He asked eagerly what I thought of them:
 
 “I see you have got at them. Are you disappointed, exhilarated? Are they
 illuminative? Tell me about them; I want so much to hear.”
 
 He had forgotten to ask how I was.
 
 “I will tell you about them presently. I haven’t read them all. Up to
 now they are certainly disappointing, if not dull! They are business
 letters, to begin with. But it is obvious she is trying to get up
 something like a flirtation with him.”
 
 “Oh, no!”
 
 “Oh, yes! I have watched Ella, my sister Mrs. Lovegrove, for years. She
 is past mistress of the art of flirtation. Sentiment and the appeal of
 her femininity, a note of unhappiness and the suggestion the man’s
 friendship may assuage it....”
 
 “Mrs. Lovegrove is a very charming woman. But Margaret Capel was not in
 the least like her.”
 
 “Or any other woman?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “You have put yourself out of court. No woman is unlike any other. Your
 ‘pale fair Margaret’ admits, from the first, that Gabriel Stanton
 attracts her. And this at a moment when she should allow herself to be
 attracted by no man. When she has just gone through the horrors of the
 Divorce Court.”
 
 “You are not bringing that up against her?”
 
 “I am not bringing anything up against her. But you asked me about the
 letters. I have only read a dozen of them, and that is how they strike
 me. A little dull and, on her part, flirtatious.”
 
 “I hope you won’t do the book at all if you don’t feel sympathetic.”
 
 “Believe me I shall be sympathetic if there is anything with which to
 sympathise. Do you know her early life, or history? It is hinted at,
 partly revealed here, but I should like to see it clearly.”
 
 “Won’t she tell you herself?” He smiled. I answered his smile.
 
 “She has left off coming since I have begun to get well. I shall have to
 write the book, if I write it at all, without further help. By the way,
 talking about getting better, I know that doctoring bores you, but I
 want to know how much better I am going to get? I am as weak as a rat;
 my legs refuse to carry me, my hand shakes when I get a pen in it. I
 shall get the story into my head from these papers,” I added, with
 something of the depression that I was feeling: “But I don’t see how I
 am to get it out again. I don’t see how I shall ever have the strength
 to put it on paper.”
 
 “That will come. There is no hurry about that. As a matter of fact I
 believe letters are copyright for fourteen years. It isn’t twelve yet.”
 
 It was not worth while to put him right on the copyright acts.
 
 “You’ll be going downstairs next week, you’ll be at your writing-table,
 her writing-table in the drawing-room. You ask me about her early life.
 I only know her father was a wealthy American absolutely devoted to her.
 He married for the second time when she was fifteen or sixteen and they
 both concentrated on her. She was remarkable even as a child, obviously
 a genius, very beautiful.”
 
 “She outgrew that,” I said emphatically.
 
 “She was a very beautiful woman,” he insisted. And then said more
 lightly, “You must remember you have only seen her ghost.” The retort
 pleased me and I let the subject of Margaret Capel’s beauty drop. She
 interested me less when I felt well, and notwithstanding my active night
 I felt comparatively well this morning. Since I could not get him to
 take my weakness seriously I told him my grievance against nurse.
 
 “When she hears I am to go down next week she will have a fit. I wish
 for once you would use your medical authority and tell her I am on no
 account to be contradicted or thwarted.”
 
 “I’ll tell her so if you like, but I never see her. She runs like a
 rabbit when I come near.”
 
 “You are not professional enough for her taste, there are too few
 examinations and prescriptions. How is my unsatisfactory lung, by the
 way? Give a guess, something scientific to retail. I must keep Ella
 informed.”
 
 “There has not been time for the physical signs to have cleared up yet.
 I’ll listen if you like, but after seeing all those specialists I should
 have thought you were tired of saying ‘99’.”
 
",Twilight
15," employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,
 I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the
 right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have
 noted even so self-evident a thing as that.”
 
 “How on earth—”
 
 “My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which
 characterizes you. You shave every morning, and in this season you
 shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete
 as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively
 slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear
 that that side is less well illuminated than the other. I could not
 imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light, and
 being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial
 example of observation and inference. Therein lies my _métier_, and it
 is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation
 which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were
 brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.”
 
 [Illustration: “THEY FOUND THE BODY”]
 
 “What are they?”
 
 “It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the
 return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing
 him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to
 hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of
 his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might
 have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”
 
 “It was a confession,” I ejaculated.
 
 “No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”
 
 “Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least
 a most suspicious remark.”
 
 “On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can
 at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could
 not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances
 were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own
 arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as
 highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural
 under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy
 to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as
 either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint
 and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
 unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his
 father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far
 forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,
 according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise
 his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which
 are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy
 mind, rather than of a guilty one.”
 
 I shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”
 I remarked.
 
 “So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”
 
 “What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”
 
 “It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though
 there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find
 it here, and may read it for yourself.”
 
 He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,
 and having turned down the sheet, he pointed out the paragraph in which
 the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had
 occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage, and read
 it very carefully. It ran in this way:
 
 “Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called, and
 gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at
 Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,
 the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and
 I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John
 Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap
 in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk
 rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he
 was going. I then took my gun, and strolled out in the direction of
 the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit-warren
 which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the
 game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in
 thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in
 front of me. When about a hundred yards from the Pool I heard a cry of
 “Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then
 hurried forward, and found him standing by the Pool. He appeared to be
 much surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what I was
 doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words, and almost
 to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing
 that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him, and returned
 towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,
 when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back
 again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head
 terribly injured. I dropped my gun, and held him in my arms, but he
 almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then
 made my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest,
 to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and
 I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,
 being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners; but he had, as far
 as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’
 
 “The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?
 
 “Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion
 to a rat.
 
 “The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
 
 “Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.
 
 “The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had
 this final quarrel?
 
 “Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
 
 “The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
 
 “Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you
 that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.
 
 “The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to
 you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably
 in any future proceedings which may arise.
 
 “Witness: I must still refuse.
 
 “The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal
 between you and your father?
 
 “Witness: It was.
 
 “The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,
 and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
 
 “Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
 
 “A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you
 returned on hearing the cry, and found your father fatally injured?
 
 “Witness: Nothing definite.
 
 “The Coroner: What do you mean?
 
 “Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,
 that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague
 impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the
 left of me. It seemed to me to be something gray in color, a coat of
 some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked
 round for it, but it was gone.
 
 “‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’
 
 “‘Yes, it was gone.’
 
 “‘You cannot say what it was?’
 
 “‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’
 
 “‘How far from the body?’
 
 “‘A dozen yards or so.’
 
 “‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’
 
 “‘About the same.’
 
 “‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of
 it?’
 
 “‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’
 
 “This concluded the examination of the witness.”
 
 “I see,” said I, as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in
 his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls
 attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having
 signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details
 of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his
 father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against
 the son.”
 
 Holmes laughed softly to himself, and stretched himself out upon the
 cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,”
 said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s
 favor. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having
 too much imagination and too little. Too little, if he could not invent
 a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury;
 too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything
 so _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the
 vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of
 view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither
 that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
 not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of
 action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty
 minutes.”
 
 It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through
 the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,
 found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,
 ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the
 platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings
 which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no
 difficulty in recognizing Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove
 to the Hereford Arms, where a room had already been engaged for us.
 
 “I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade, as we sat over a cup of
 tea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy
 until you had been on the scene of the crime.”
 
 “It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is
 entirely a question of barometric pressure.”
 
 Lestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.
 
 “How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the
 sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the
 sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do
 not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”
 
 Lestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your
 conclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a
 pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,
 of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.
 She had heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly
 told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not
 already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”
 
 He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most
 lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes
 shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of
 her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.
 
 “Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other
 of us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my
 companion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell
 you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to
 start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon
 that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and
 I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to
 hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to any one who really knows him.”
 
 “I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may
 rely upon my doing all that I can.”
 
 “But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do
 you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he
 is innocent?”
 
 “I think that it is very probable.”
 
 “There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head, and looking defiantly
 at Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”
 
 Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has
 been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.
 
 “But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And
 about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he
 would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in
 it.”
 
 “In what way?” asked Holmes.
 
 “It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many
 disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should
 be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as
 brother and sister; but of course he is young, and has seen very little
 of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything
 like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of
 them.”
 
 “And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favor of such a union?”
 
 “No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favor of
 it.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one
 of his keen, questioning glances at her.
 
 “Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I
 call to-morrow?”
 
 “I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”
 
 “The doctor?”
 
 “Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years
 back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,
 and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck, and that his nervous system is
 shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the
 old days in Victoria.”
 
 “Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”
 
 “Yes, at the mines.”
 
 “Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made
 his money.”
 
 “Yes, certainly.”
 
 “Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”
 
 “You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go
 to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that
 I know him to be innocent.”
 
 “I will, Miss Turner.”
 
 “I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I
 leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried
 from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the
 wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
 
 “I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade, with dignity, after a few
 minutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to
 disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”
 
 “I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said Holmes.
 “Have you an order to see him in prison?”
 
 “Yes, but only for you and me.”
 
 “Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still
 time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”
 
 “Ample.”
 
 “Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but
 I shall only be away a couple of hours.”
 
 I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the
 streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I
 lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed
 novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared
 to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my
 attention wander so continually from the fiction to the fact, that I
 at last flung it across the room, and gave myself up entirely to a
 consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy
 young man’s story was absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what
 absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred
 between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,
 drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something
 terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the
 injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell,
 and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim
 account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that
 the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the
 occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.
 I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been
 struck from behind. That was to some extent in favor of the accused,
 as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still,
 it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his
 back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call
 Holmes’s attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference
 to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying
 from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more
 likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could
 it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.
 And then the incident of the gray cloth, seen by young McCarthy. If
 that were true, the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,
 presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood
 to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling
 with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries
 and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s
 opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’s insight that
 I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen
 his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.
 
 It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for
 Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
 
 “The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked, as he sat down. “It is
 of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the
 ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest
 for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by
 a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”
 
 “And what did you learn from him?”
 
 “Nothing.”
 
 “Could he throw no light?”
 
 “None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had
 done it, and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he
 is as puzzled as every one else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,
 though comely to look at, and, I should think, sound at heart.”
 
 “I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that
 he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss
 Turner.”
 
 “Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
 insanely in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a
 lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at
 a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of
 a barmaid in Bristol, and marry her at a registry office? No one knows
 a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to
 him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to
 do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy
 of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his
 father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
 Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and
 his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown
 him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife
 that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did
 not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has
 come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
 that he is in serious trouble, and likely to be hanged, has thrown
 him over utterly, and has written to him to say that she has a husband
 already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between
 them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
 that he has suffered.”
 
 “But if he is innocent, who has done it?”
 
 “Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.
 One is that the murdered man had an appointment with some one at the
 Pool, and that the some one could not have been his son, for his son
 was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that
 the murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son
 had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends.
 And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall
 leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”
 
 There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke
 bright and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the
 carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.
 
 “There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said
 that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”
 
 “An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.
 
 “About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
 abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business
 has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s,
 and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he
 gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”
 
 “Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.
 
 “Oh yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about
 here speaks of his kindness to him.”
 
 “Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
 McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been
 under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his
 son to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate,
 and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of
 a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we
 know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us
 as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”
 
 “We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,
 winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without
 flying away after theories and fancies.”
 
 “You are right,” said Holmes, demurely; “you do find it very hard to
 tackle the facts.”
 
 “Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to
 get hold of,” replied Lestrade, with some warmth.
 
 “And that is—”
 
 “That McCarthy, senior, met his death from McCarthy, junior, and that
 all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”
 
 “Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing.
 “But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the
 left.”
 
 “Yes, that is it.” It was a wide-spread, comfortable-looking building,
 two-storied, slate roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon
 the gray walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,
 gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still
 lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’s
 request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his
 death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had
 then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight
 different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from
 which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
 
 [Illustration: “THE MAID SHOWED US THE BOOTS.”]
 
 Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
 as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
 Baker Street would have failed to recognize him. His face flushed and
 darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard, black lines, while his
 eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was
 bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins
 stood out like whip-cord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed
 to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so
 absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him, that a question
 or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked
 a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his
 way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of
 the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all
 that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path
 and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes
 Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a
 little _détour_ into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the
 detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with
 the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his
 actions was directed towards a definite end.
 
 The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some
 fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley
 Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods
 which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting
 pinnacles which marked the site of the rich land-owner’s dwelling. On
 the Hatherley side of the Pool the woods grew very thick, and there was
 a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of
 the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the
 exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was
 the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by
 the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
 face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the
 trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and
 then turned upon my companion.
 
 “What did you go into the Pool for?” he asked.
 
 “I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or
 other trace. But how on earth—”
 
 “Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward
 twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it
 vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I
 been here before they came like a herd of buffalo, and wallowed all
 over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they
 have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But
 here are three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens,
 and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all
 the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s
 feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly so that the soles
 are deeply marked, and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his
 story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the
 father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the
 butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What
 have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They
 come, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak.
 Now where did they come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing,
 sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the
 wood, and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the
 neighborhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this, and
 lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.
 For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried
 sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope, and
 examining with his lens not only the ground, but even the bark of the
 tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss,
 and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a
 pathway through the wood until he came to the high-road, where all
 traces were lost.
 
 “It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning
 to his natural manner. “I fancy that this gray house on the right must
 be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and
 perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our
 luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”
 
 It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab, and drove back
 into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked
 up in the wood.
 
 “This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The
 murder was done with it.”
 
 “I see no marks.”
 
 “There are none.”
 
 “How do you know, then?”
 
 “The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.
 There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds
 with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”
 
 “And the murderer?”
 
 “Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
 thick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses
 a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket. There are
 several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our
 search.”
 
 Lestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.
 “Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed
 British jury.”
 
 “_Nous verrons_,” answered Holmes, calmly. “You work your own method,
 and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall
 probably return to London by the evening train.”
 
 “And leave your case unfinished?”
 
 “No, finished.”
 
 “But the mystery?”
 
 “It is solved.”
 
 “Who was the criminal, then?”
 
 “The gentleman I describe.”
 
 “But who is he?”
 
 “Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
 populous neighborhood.”
 
 Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said,
 “and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
 for a left-handed gentleman with a game-leg. I should become the
 laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.”
 
 “All right,” said Holmes, quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here
 are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”
 
 Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we
 found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought
 with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a
 perplexing position.
 
 “Look here, Watson,” he said, when the cloth was cleared; “just sit
 down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t quite
 know what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar, and let
 me expound.”
 
 “Pray do so.”
",Holmes
16," “Didn’t know, you white-livered thief!” growled Sikes. “Couldn’t you
 hear the noise?”
 
 “Not a sound of it, as I’m a living man, Bill,” replied the Jew.
 
 “Oh no! You hear nothing, you don’t,” retorted Sikes with a fierce
 sneer. “Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I
 wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.”
 
 “Why?” inquired the Jew with a forced smile.
 
 “Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as
 haven’t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,”
 replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;
 “that’s why.”
 
 The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to
 laugh at the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill at
 ease, however.
 
 “Grin away,” said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with
 savage contempt; “grin away. You’ll never have the laugh at me, though,
 unless it’s behind a nightcap. I’ve got the upper hand over you, Fagin;
 and, d—me, I’ll keep it. There! If I go, you go; so take care of me.”
 
 “Well, well, my dear,” said the Jew, “I know all that; we—we—have a
 mutual interest, Bill,—a mutual interest.”
 
 “Humph,” said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on
 the Jew’s side than on his. “Well, what have you got to say to me?”
 
 “It’s all passed safe through the melting-pot,” replied Fagin, “and
 this is your share. It’s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but
 as I know you’ll do me a good turn another time, and—”
 
 “Stow that gammon,” interposed the robber, impatiently. “Where is it?
 Hand over!”
 
 “Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,” replied the Jew,
 soothingly. “Here it is! All safe!” As he spoke, he drew forth an old
 cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one
 corner, produced a small brown-paper packet. Sikes, snatching it from
 him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it
 contained.
 
 “This is all, is it?” inquired Sikes.
 
 “All,” replied the Jew.
 
 “You haven’t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come
 along, have you?” inquired Sikes, suspiciously. “Don’t put on an
 injured look at the question; you’ve done it many a time. Jerk the
 tinkler.”
 
 These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.
 It was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile
 and repulsive in appearance.
 
 Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly
 understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a
 remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if
 in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the
 action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third
 person. It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie
 the boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the
 brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no
 good to him.
 
 “Is anybody here, Barney?” inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that
 Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.
 
 “Dot a shoul,” replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the
 heart or not: made their way through the nose.
 
 “Nobody?” inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might
 mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.
 
 “Dobody but Biss Dadsy,” replied Barney.
 
 “Nancy!” exclaimed Sikes. “Where? Strike me blind, if I don’t honour
 that ’ere girl, for her native talents.”
 
 “She’s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,” replied Barney.
 
 “Send her here,” said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. “Send her
 here.”
 
 Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining
 silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and
 presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the
 bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.
 
 “You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?” inquired Sikes, proffering the
 glass.
 
 “Yes, I am, Bill,” replied the young lady, disposing of its contents;
 “and tired enough of it I am, too. The young brat’s been ill and
 confined to the crib; and—”
 
 “Ah, Nancy, dear!” said Fagin, looking up.
 
 Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew’s red eye-brows, and a
 half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was
 disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.
 The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she
 suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr.
 Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes’
 time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy
 pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.
 Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself,
 expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together,
 followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard
 as soon as his master was out of sight.
 
 The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;
 looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched
 fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated
 himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the
 interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.
 
 Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very
 short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the
 book-stall. When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a
 by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his
 mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in
 the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and
 so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.
 
 He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to
 feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick,
 who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment;
 when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud. “Oh, my
 dear brother!” And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was,
 when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his
 neck.
 
 “Don’t,” cried Oliver, struggling. “Let go of me. Who is it? What are
 you stopping me for?”
 
 The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from
 the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a
 street-door key in her hand.
 
 “Oh my gracious!” said the young woman, “I have found him! Oh! Oliver!
 Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your
 account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I’ve found him. Thank gracious
 goodness heavins, I’ve found him!” With these incoherent exclamations,
 the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully
 hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a
 butcher’s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was
 also looking on, whether he didn’t think he had better run for the
 doctor. To which, the butcher’s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to
 say indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not.
 
 “Oh, no, no, never mind,” said the young woman, grasping Oliver’s hand;
 “I’m better now. Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!”
 
 “Oh, ma’am,” replied the young woman, “he ran away, near a month ago,
 from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went
 and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his
 mother’s heart.”
 
 “Young wretch!” said one woman.
 
 “Go home, do, you little brute,” said the other.
 
 “I am not,” replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. “I don’t know her. I
 haven’t any sister, or father and mother either. I’m an orphan; I live
 at Pentonville.”
 
 “Only hear him, how he braves it out!” cried the young woman.
 
 “Why, it’s Nancy!” exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first
 time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.
 
 “You see he knows me!” cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. “He
 can’t help himself. Make him come home, there’s good people, or he’ll
 kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!”
 
 “What the devil’s this?” said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with
 a white dog at his heels; “young Oliver! Come home to your poor mother,
 you young dog! Come home directly.”
 
 “I don’t belong to them. I don’t know them. Help! help!” cried Oliver,
 struggling in the man’s powerful grasp.
 
 “Help!” repeated the man. “Yes; I’ll help you, you young rascal! What
 books are these? You’ve been a stealing ’em, have you? Give ’em here.”
 With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck
 him on the head.
 
 “That’s right!” cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. “That’s the
 only way of bringing him to his senses!”
 
 “To be sure!” cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look
 at the garret-window.
 
 “It’ll do him good!” said the two women.
 
 “And he shall have it, too!” rejoined the man, administering another
 blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. “Come on, you young villain!
 Here, Bull’s-eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!”
 
 Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of
 the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the
 brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders
 that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be;
 what could one poor child do! Darkness had set in; it was a low
 neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless. In another
 moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was
 forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to
 give utterance to, unintelligible. It was of little moment, indeed,
 whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for
 them, had they been ever so plain.
 
 
 The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the
 open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if
 there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat,
 perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XVI.
 RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY
 
 
 The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open
 space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other
 indications of a cattle-market. Sikes slackened his pace when they
 reached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer,
 the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked. Turning to Oliver, he
 roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy’s hand.
 
 “Do you hear?” growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.
 
 They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.
 
 Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He
 held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.
 
 “Give me the other,” said Sikes, seizing Oliver’s unoccupied hand.
 “Here, Bull’s-Eye!”
 
 The dog looked up, and growled.
 
 “See here, boy!” said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver’s throat;
 “if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! D’ye mind!”
 
 The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were
 anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.
 
 “He’s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn’t!” said
 Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval.
 “Now, you know what you’ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick
 as you like; the dog will soon stop that game. Get on, young’un!”
 
 Bull’s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually
 endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl
 for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.
 
 It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been
 Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night
 was dark and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle
 through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the
 streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger
 in Oliver’s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and
 depressing.
 
 They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the
 hour. With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned
 their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.
 
 “Eight o’clock, Bill,” said Nancy, when the bell ceased.
 
 “What’s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can’t I!” replied
 Sikes.
 
 “I wonder whether _they_ can hear it,” said Nancy.
 
 “Of course they can,” replied Sikes. “It was Bartlemy time when I was
 shopped; and there warn’t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn’t
 hear the squeaking on. Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and
 din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost
 have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.”
 
 “Poor fellow!” said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the
 quarter in which the bell had sounded. “Oh, Bill, such fine young chaps
 as them!”
 
 “Yes; that’s all you women think of,” answered Sikes. “Fine young
 chaps! Well, they’re as good as dead, so it don’t much matter.”
 
 With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency
 to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver’s wrist more firmly, told him to step
 out again.
 
 “Wait a minute!” said the girl: “I wouldn’t hurry by, if it was you
 that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o’clock struck,
 Bill. I’d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow
 was on the ground, and I hadn’t a shawl to cover me.”
 
 “And what good would that do?” inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes.
 “Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout
 rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at
 all, for all the good it would do me. Come on, and don’t stand
 preaching there.”
 
 The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and
 they walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in
 her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly
 white.
 
 They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full
 half-hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from their
 looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.
 At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of
 old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there
 was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the
 door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was
 in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating
 that it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for many
 years.
 
 “All right,” cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.
 
 Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.
 They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few
 moments under a lamp. A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised,
 was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then
 seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and
 all three were quickly inside the house.
 
 The passage was perfectly dark. They waited, while the person who had
 let them in, chained and barred the door.
 
 “Anybody here?” inquired Sikes.
 
 “No,” replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.
 
 “Is the old ’un here?” asked the robber.
 
 “Yes,” replied the voice, “and precious down in the mouth he has been.
 Won’t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!”
 
 The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,
 seemed familiar to Oliver’s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish
 even the form of the speaker in the darkness.
 
 “Let’s have a glim,” said Sikes, “or we shall go breaking our necks, or
 treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!”
 
 “Stand still a moment, and I’ll get you one,” replied the voice. The
 receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute,
 the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. He
 bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft
 stick.
 
 The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of
 recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away,
 beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They
 crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low
 earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small
 back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.
 
 “Oh, my wig, my wig!” cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the
 laughter had proceeded: “here he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin,
 look at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can’t bear it; it is such a jolly
 game, I can’t bear it. Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.”
 
 With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself
 flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an
 ectasy of facetious joy. Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the
 cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round
 and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number
 of low bows to the bewildered boy. The Artful, meantime, who was of a
 rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it
 interfered with business, rifled Oliver’s pockets with steady
 assiduity.
 
 “Look at his togs, Fagin!” said Charley, putting the light so close to
 his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. “Look at his togs!
 Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And
 his books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!”
 
 “Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,” said the Jew, bowing
 with mock humility. “The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear,
 for fear you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn’t you write, my
 dear, and say you were coming? We’d have got something warm for
 supper.”
 
 At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,
 and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound
 note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery
 awakened his merriment.
 
 “Hallo, what’s that?” inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew
 seized the note. “That’s mine, Fagin.”
 
 “No, no, my dear,” said the Jew. “Mine, Bill, mine. You shall have the
 books.”
 
 “If that ain’t mine!” said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a
 determined air; “mine and Nancy’s that is; I’ll take the boy back
 again.”
 
 The Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different
 cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being
 taken back.
 
 “Come! Hand over, will you?” said Sikes.
 
 “This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?” inquired the
 Jew.
 
 “Fair, or not fair,” retorted Sikes, “hand over, I tell you! Do you
 think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time
 but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as
 gets grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton,
 give it here!”
 
 With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between
 the Jew’s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face,
 folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.
 
 “That’s for our share of the trouble,” said Sikes; “and not half
 enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you’re fond of reading. If
 you ain’t, sell ’em.”
 
 “They’re very pretty,” said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces,
 had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; “beautiful
 writing, isn’t is, Oliver?” At sight of the dismayed look with which
 Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a
 lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more
 boisterous than the first.
 
 “They belong to the old gentleman,” said Oliver, wringing his hands;
 “to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had
 me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back;
 send him back the books and money. Keep me here all my life long; but
 pray, pray send them back. He’ll think I stole them; the old lady: all
 of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them. Oh, do have
 mercy upon me, and send them back!”
 
 With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate
 grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew’s feet; and beat his hands
 together, in perfect desperation.
 
 “The boy’s right,” remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting
 his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. “You’re right, Oliver, you’re
 right; they _will_ think you have stolen ’em. Ha! ha!” chuckled the
 Jew, rubbing his hands, “it couldn’t have happened better, if we had
 chosen our time!”
 
 “Of course it couldn’t,” replied Sikes; “I know’d that, directly I see
 him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm. It’s all
 right enough. They’re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn’t have
 taken him in at all; and they’ll ask no questions after him, fear they
 should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged. He’s safe
 enough.”
 
 Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being
 spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what
 passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet,
 and tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made
 the bare old house echo to the roof.
 
 “Keep back the dog, Bill!” cried Nancy, springing before the door, and
 closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. “Keep
 back the dog; he’ll tear the boy to pieces.”
 
 “Serve him right!” cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from
 the girl’s grasp. “Stand off from me, or I’ll split your head against
 the wall.”
 
 “I don’t care for that, Bill, I don’t care for that,” screamed the
 girl, struggling violently with the man, “the child shan’t be torn down
 by the dog, unless you kill me first.”
 
 “Shan’t he!” said Sikes, setting his teeth. “I’ll soon do that, if you
 don’t keep off.”
 
 The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the
 room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among
 them.
 
 “What’s the matter here!” said Fagin, looking round.
 
 “The girl’s gone mad, I think,” replied Sikes, savagely.
 
 “No, she hasn’t,” said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle;
 “no, she hasn’t, Fagin; don’t think it.”
 
 “Then keep quiet, will you?” said the Jew, with a threatening look.
 
 “No, I won’t do that, neither,” replied Nancy, speaking very loud.
 “Come! What do you think of that?”
 
 Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs
 of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel
 tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any
 conversation with her, at present. With the view of diverting the
 attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.
 
 “So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?” said the Jew, taking up
 a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; “eh?”
 
 Oliver made no reply. But he watched the Jew’s motions, and breathed
 quickly.
 
 “Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?” sneered the
 Jew, catching the boy by the arm. “We’ll cure you of that, my young
 master.”
 
 The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver’s shoulders with the club; and
 was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it
 from his hand. She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought
 some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.
 
 “I won’t stand by and see it done, Fagin,” cried the girl. “You’ve got
 the boy, and what more would you have?—Let him be—let him be—or I shall
 put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before
 my time.”
 
 The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this
 threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked
 alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless
 from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.
 
 “Why, Nancy!” said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during
 which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted
 manner; “you,—you’re more clever than ever to-night. Ha! ha! my dear,
 you are acting beautifully.”
 
 “Am I!” said the girl. “Take care I don’t overdo it. You will be the
 worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep
 clear of me.”
 
 There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all
 her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and
 despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be
 hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss
 Nancy’s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a
 glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that
 he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.
 
 Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal
 pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy
 to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and
 threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the
 fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the
 object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more
 tangible arguments.
 
 “What do you mean by this?” said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very
 common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features:
 which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand
 times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a
 disorder as measles: “what do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know
 who you are, and what you are?”
 
 “Oh, yes, I know all about it,” replied the girl, laughing
 hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor
 assumption of indifference.
 
 “Well, then, keep quiet,” rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was
 accustomed to use when addressing his dog, “or I’ll quiet you for a
 good long time to come.”
 
 The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting
 a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the
 blood came.
 
 “You’re a nice one,” added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a
 contemptuous air, “to take up the humane and gen—teel side! A pretty
 subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!”
 
 “God Almighty help me, I am!” cried the girl passionately; “and I wish
 I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them
 we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him
 here. He’s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that’s bad, from this night
 forth. Isn’t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?”
 
 “Come, come, Sikes,” said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory
 tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all
 that passed; “we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.”
 
 “Civil words!” cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.
 “Civil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve ’em from me. I thieved for
 you when I was a child not half as old as this!” pointing to Oliver. “I
 have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years
 since. Don’t you know it? Speak out! Don’t you know it?”
 
 “Well, well,” replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; “and,
 if you have, it’s your living!”
 
 “Aye, it is!” returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the
 words in one continuous and vehement scream. “It is my living; and the
 cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you’re the wretch that drove
 me to them long ago, and that’ll keep me there, day and night, day and
 night, till I die!”
 
 “I shall do you a mischief!” interposed the Jew, goaded by these
 reproaches; “a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!”
 
 The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a
 transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably
 have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been
 seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few
 ineffectual struggles, and fainted.
 
 “She’s all right now,” said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. “She’s
 uncommon strong in the arms, when she’s up in this way.”
 
 The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have
 the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the
 boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance
 incidental to business.
 
 “It’s the worst of having to do with women,” said the Jew, replacing
 his club; “but they’re clever, and we can’t get on, in our line,
 without ’em. Charley, show Oliver to bed.”
 
 “I suppose he’d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had
 he?” inquired Charley Bates.
 
 “Certainly not,” replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which
 Charley put the question.
 
 Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the
 cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were
 two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with
 many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old
 suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon
 leaving off at Mr. Brownlow’s; and the accidental display of which, to
 Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue
 received, of his whereabout.
 
 “Put off the smart ones,” said Charley, “and I’ll give ’em to Fagin to
 take care of. What fun it is!”
 
 Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new
 clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the
 dark, and locking the door behind him.
 
 The noise of Charley’s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who
 opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other
 feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept
 many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which
 Oliver was placed. But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound
 asleep.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XVII.
 OLIVER’S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON
 TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION
 
 
 It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to
 present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as
 the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero sinks
 upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the
 next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience
 with a comic song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the
 grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in
 danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the
 other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest
 pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the
 great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny
 chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of
 places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company,
 carolling perpetually.
 
 Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would
 seem at first sight. The transitions in real life from well-spread
 boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are
 not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of
 passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference. The actors in the
 mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt
 impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of
 mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.
 
 As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place,
 are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many
 considered as the great art of authorship: an author’s skill in his
 craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the
 dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter:
 this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed
 unnecessary. If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the
 part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver
 Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good
 and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be
 invited to proceed upon such an expedition.
 
 Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked
 with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was
 in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were
 dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous
 tenacity of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high;
 but this morning it was higher than usual. There was an abstraction in
 his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant
 stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle’s mind, too great for
 utterance.
 
 Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and
 others who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along. He merely
 returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in
 his dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended
 the infant paupers with parochial care.
 
 “Drat that beadle!” said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at
 the garden-gate. “If it isn’t him at this time in the morning! Lauk,
 Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it _is_ a
 pleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.”
 
 The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of
 delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the
 garden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the
 house.
 
 “Mrs. Mann,” said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself
 into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself
 gradually and slowly down into a chair; “Mrs. Mann, ma’am, good
 morning.”
 
 “Well, and good morning to _you_, sir,” replied Mrs. Mann, with many
 smiles; “and hoping you find yourself well, sir!”
 
 “So-so, Mrs. Mann,” replied the beadle. “A porochial life is not a bed
 of roses, Mrs. Mann.”
 
 “Ah, that it isn’t indeed, Mr. Bumble,” rejoined the lady. And all the
 infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety,
 if they had heard it.
 
 “A porochial life, ma’am,” continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table
 with his cane, “is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but
 all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.”
 
 Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her
 hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed.
 
 “Ah! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!” said the beadle.
 
 Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the
 satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent
 smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,
 
 “Mrs. Mann, I am going to London.”
 
 “Lauk, Mr. Bumble!” cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.
 
 “To London, ma’am,” resumed the inflexible beadle, “by coach. I and two
 paupers, Mrs. Mann! A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement;
 and the board has appointed me—me, Mrs. Mann—to dispose to the matter
 before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.
 
 And I very much question,” added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,
 “whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong
 box before they have done with me.”
 
 “Oh! you mustn’t be too hard upon them, sir,” said Mrs. Mann,
 coaxingly.
 
 “The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma’am,”
 replied Mr. Bumble; “and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they
 come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have
 only themselves to thank.”
 
 There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing
 manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.
 Mann appeared quite awed by them. At length she said,
 
 “You’re going by coach, sir? I thought it was always usual to send them
 paupers in carts.”
 
 “That’s when they’re ill, Mrs. Mann,” said the beadle. “We put the sick
 paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking
 cold.”
 
 “Oh!” said Mrs. Mann.
 
 “The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,”
 said Mr. Bumble. “They are both in a very low state, and we find it
 would come two pound cheaper to move ’em than to bury ’em—that is, if
 we can throw ’em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to
 do, if they don’t die upon the road to spite us. Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered
 the cocked hat; and he became grave.
 
 “We are forgetting business, ma’am,” said the beadle; “here is your
 porochial stipend for the month.”
 
 Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his
 pocket-book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote.
 
 “It’s very much blotted, sir,” said the farmer of infants; “but it’s
 formal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much
 obliged to you, I’m sure.”
 
 Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann’s curtsey;
 and inquired how the children were.
 
 “Bless their dear little hearts!” said Mrs. Mann with emotion, “they’re
 as well as can be, the dears! Of course, except the two that died last
 week. And little Dick.”
 
 “Isn’t that boy no better?” inquired Mr. Bumble.
 
 Mrs. Mann shook her head.
 
 “He’s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,”
 said Mr. Bumble angrily. “Where is he?”
 
 “I’ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,” replied Mrs. Mann. “Here,
 you Dick!”
 
 After some calling, Dick was discovered. Having had his face put under
 the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann’s gown, he was led into the awful
 presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.
 
 The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large
 and bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung
 loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like
 those of an old man.
 
 Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble’s
 glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even
 to hear the beadle’s voice.
 
 “Can’t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?” said Mrs. Mann.
 
 The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.
 
 “What’s the matter with you, porochial Dick?” inquired Mr. Bumble, with
 well-timed jocularity.
 
 “Nothing, sir,” replied the child faintly.
 
 “I should think not,” said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very
 much at Mr. Bumble’s humour.
 
 “You want for nothing, I’m sure.”
 
 “I should like—” faltered the child.
 
 “Hey-day!” interposed Mrs. Mann, “I suppose you’re going to say that
 you _do_ want for something, now? Why, you little wretch—”
 
 “Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!” said the beadle, raising his hand with a show
 of authority. “Like what, sir, eh?”
 
 “I should like,” faltered the child, “if somebody that can write, would
 put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and
 seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.”
 
 “Why, what does the boy mean?” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the
 earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression:
 accustomed as he was to such things. “What do you mean, sir?”
 
 “I should like,” said the child, “to leave my dear love to poor Oliver
 Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to
 think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help
 him. And I should like to tell him,” said the child pressing his small
 hands together, and speaking with great fervour, “that I was glad to
 die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man,
 and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me,
 or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both
 children there together.”
 
 Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with
 indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said,
 “They’re all in one story, Mrs. Mann. That out-dacious Oliver had
 demogalized them all!”
 
 “I couldn’t have believed it, sir” said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands,
 and looking malignantly at Dick. “I never see such a hardened little
 wretch!”
 
 “Take him away, ma’am!” said Mr. Bumble imperiously. “This must be
 stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.”
 
 “I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn’t my fault, sir?”
 said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.
 
 “They shall understand that, ma’am; they shall be acquainted with the
 true state of the case,” said Mr. Bumble. “There; take him away, I
 can’t bear the sight on him.”
 
 Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar. Mr.
 Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.
 
 At six o’clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his cocked
 hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a
 cape to it: took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by
 the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course
 of time, he arrived in London.
 
 He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated
 in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in
 shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble
 declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel
 quite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on.
 
 Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble
 sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a
 temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass
 of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the
 fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of
 discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.
 
 The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble’s eye rested, was the
 following advertisement.
 
 “FIVE GUINEAS REWARD
 
 
 “Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on
 Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since
 been heard of. The above reward will be paid to any person who will
 give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver
 Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which
 the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.”
 
 And then followed a full description of Oliver’s dress, person,
 appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr.
 Brownlow at full length.
 
 Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and
 carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes
 was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left
 the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.
 
 “Is Mr. Brownlow at home?” inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened
 the door.
 
 To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive
 reply of “I don’t know; where do you come from?”
 
 Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver’s name, in explanation of his
 errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door,
 hastened into the passage in a breathless state.
 
 “Come in, come in,” said the old lady: “I knew we should hear of him.
 Poor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his heart! I
 said so all along.”
 
 Having heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour
 again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who
 was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now
 returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately:
 which he did.
",OliverTwist
17," “It is a pity,” I laughed at him. “You should not have dropped giving me
 the morphia so soon.”
 
 “You wouldn’t have it.”
 
 “It was dulling my brain. I felt myself growing stupid and more stupid.”
 
 “You only had one-quarter grain twice a day for the inside of a week,
 and there was atropin in it. If it had really had a deadening effect
 upon you you would not have refused it, but just gone on. Not that I
 believe anything would ever dull _your_ brain.”
 
 I wished Ella could have heard him, it would have confirmed her in her
 folly and made for my amusement. He left shortly after paying me that
 remarkable compliment, but stopped on his way out to speak to Benham.
 The immediate effect of his words was to make her silent and perhaps
 sullen for a few hours. After which, but still under protest, she gave
 me whatever I asked for, and began to be more like other nurses in the
 time she took off duty for exercise, sleep, and meals. She even yawned
 in my face on the rare occasions when I summoned her in the night. I
 tried to chaff her back into good humour, but without much success.
 
 “Do you find me any worse for having got out of leading strings?” I
 asked her. “Have pencils and MS. paper sent up my temperature?”
 
 “You are not out of the wood yet,” she retorted angrily.
 
 “No, but I am enjoying its umbrageous rest,” I returned. “Reading my
 papers in the shadows.”
 
 “Shadow enough!”
 
 “That’s right. Mind you go on keeping up my spirits.” She did smile
 then, but she was obviously dissatisfied, both with me and Dr. Kennedy.
 I was taking no drugs, doing a little more each day, in the way of
 moving about. And yet I could not call myself convalescent. My legs were
 stiff and my back heavy. I had no feeling of returning vigour. What
 little I did I forced myself to do. I had hardly the energy to finish
 the letters. Had it not been for Dr. Kennedy I don’t believe, at this
 stage, I should have finished them! Although the next two or three set
 me thinking, and I was again visualising the writers. Not that Gabriel
 Stanton betrayed himself in his letters, as Margaret did in hers. I had
 to reconcile him with the donnish master of Greek roots, whom I had met
 and been ignored by, in Greyfriars’ Square. This was his answer to her
 last effusion.
 
   No. 13.
 
                                           118 Greyfriars’ Square,
                                                   19th February, 1902.
 
   _Dear Mrs. Capel_:—
 
   I have read your letter ten—twenty times; my business day was filled
   and transformed by it. Now it is midnight and I am alone in the
   stillness of my room, the routine of the day and the evening over,
   and my brain, not always very quick, alight with the wonderment of
   your words, and my restless anxiety to respond. Don’t, I implore
   you, belittle the possibility of friendship!
 
   Surely the value of it is only proved by its needs?
 
   May I not say that in this crisis in your life friendship may be
   much to you. Can I hope that my privilege may be to fill the need?
 
   _You_ have been so splendidly frank and outspoken. _I_ have suffered
   all my life from a sort of stupid reticence, probably cowardly. But
   tonight, and to you, I want to throw off the habit of years and not
   miss, before it is too late, the luxury of being natural.
 
   Well, I am hot with hatred that you should have been hurt, and yet I
   am happy that you have told me of your wounds. Tonight I pray that
   it may be given to me to heal them.
 
   I am writing this because I must—though conventionally the shortness
   of our acquaintance does not justify me. But I have been
   conventional so long—circumstance has ruled and limited my doings.
   And tonight it comes to me that chance and fate are, or should be,
   greater than environment. The Gods only rarely offer gifts, and the
   blackness and blankness of despair follow their refusal. So I cling
   to the hope that they have now offered me a precious gift, and that
   in spite of all your pain—all the past which now so embitters you,
   to me may come the chance in some small way of proving to you that
   in friendship there is healing, and in sympathy and understanding,
   at least the hope of forgetfulness.
 
   I shall hardly dare to read over what I have written, for I should
   either be conscious that it is inadequate to express what I have
   wanted to say to you—or that I have presumed too much in writing
   what is in my mind.
 
   Look upon those Musicians as playing a prelude, not to a dream but
   to a happier future, and then my pleasure in the little gift will be
   enormously increased.
 
   It has been a sort of joke in my family that I am over-cautious and
   too deliberate, but for tonight at least in these still quiet hours
   I mean to conquer this, and go out to post this letter myself; just
   as I have written it, with no alteration; yet with confidence in the
   kindness you have already shown me.
 
   And I shall see you at dinner on Thursday.
 
                                           Yours very sincerely,
                                                       GABRIEL STANTON.
 
 A little over a fortnight passed before there was any further
 correspondence. Meanwhile the two must have met frequently. Her letters
 were often undated, and her figures even more difficult to read than her
 handwriting generally. The hieroglyphic over the following looks like 5,
 but I could not be sure. The intimacy between them must have grown
 apace, and yet the running away could have been nothing but a ruse.
 There could have been little fear of so sedate a lover as Gabriel
 Stanton. I found something artificial in the next letter of hers,
 recapitulative, as if already she had publication in her mind. Of course
 it is more difficult for a novelist or a playwright to be genuine and
 simple with a pen than it is for a person of a different avocation, but
 I could not help thinking how much better than Margaret Ella would have
 acted her part, and my sympathy began to flow more definitely toward the
 inexperienced gentleman, no longer young, to whom she was introducing
 the game of flirtation under the old name of Platonic friendship.

                                                             Pineland,
                                                       March 5th, 1902.
 
   I have run away, you realise this, don’t you, simply turned tail and
   run. That long dinner which seemed so short; the British Museum the
   next day, and your illuminating lecture so abruptly ended—that
   dreadful lunch ... boiled fish and ginger beer! Ye Gods! Greek or
   Roman, how could you appear satisfied, eat with appetite? I sickened
   in the atmosphere. Thursday at the National Gallery was better. Our
   taste in pictures is the same if our taste in food differs. But
   perhaps you did not know what you were given in the refreshment room
   of the British Museum? I throw out this suggestion as an extenuating
   circumstance, for I find it difficult to forgive you that languid
   cod and its egg sauce. Our other two meals together were so
   different. That first lunch at the Café Royal was perfect in its
   way. As for our dinner, did I not myself superintend the ménu, curb
   the exuberance of the chef and my stepmother; dock the unfashionable
   sorbet; change Mayonnaise sauce into Hollandaise; duck and green
   peas into an idealised animal of the same variety, stuffed with foie
   gras, enriched and decorated with cherries? For you I devoted myself
   to the decoration of the table, interested myself in the wine list
   my father produced, discussed vintages with our pompous and absurd
   butler. I must tell you a story about that butler. You said he
   looked like an Archdeacon. Can you imagine an Archdeacon in the
   Divorce Court? No! No! No! Nothing to do with mine. Had it been I
   could not have written of it, the very thought sets me writhing
   again. Poor Burden was with the Sylvestres, you remember the case.
   Everybody defended and it was fought for five interminable days. The
   papers devoted columns to it, nothing else was discussed in the
   Clubs, the whole air of London—Mayfair end—was fœtid and foul with
   it. Burden was a witness, he had seen too much, and his evidence
   sent poor silly Ann Sylvestre to hide her divorced and disgraced
   head in Monte Carlo. And can a head properly _ondulé_ be said to be
   divorced? Heavens! how my pen runs on, or away, like me. And I
   haven’t come to the story, which now I come to think of it is not so
   _very_ good. I will tell you it in Burden’s own words. He applied
   for our situation through a registry office, and stood before my
   stepmother and me, hat in hand, sorrowful, but always dignified, as
   he answered questions.
 
   “My last situation was with a Mrs. Solomon. I’m sorry, milady, to
   have to ask you to take up a character from such people. I’d always
   been in the best service before that.... I was hallboy with the
   Jutes, third and then second with His Grace the Duke of Richland,
   first footman under the Countess Foreglass. I was five years with
   the Sylvestres; you know, Ma’am, he was first cousin to the Duke of
   Trent, near to the Throne itself, as one might say. I’d never
   lowered myself to an untitled family before. But after the divorce I
   couldn’t get nothing. Ma’am, I hope you’ll believe me, but from the
   moment I accepted Mr. Solomon’s place all I was planning to do was
   to get out of it. They was Jews, if I may mention such a thing to
   you. I took ten pounds a year less than I’d had at his Lordship’s,
   but Mr. Solomon, he said in his facetious way that being in the
   witness box ’ad knocked at least ten pounds off my value, an’ he
   ground me down. But I’ll have to ask you to take up my character
   from him. That’s the worst of it, Ma’am, milady.”
 
   We had to break it to him that we were without titles, but he said
   sorrowfully that having been in a witness box in the divorce court
   made it impossible for him to stand out.
 
   Burden and I have always been on good terms. I understand him, you
   see, his point of view, and his descent in the social scale when he
   went to live with Jews. What I was going to tell you was, that
   notwithstanding our friendship he resented my interference in his
   department when I insisted on selecting the wine for your—our—dinner
   party. I am almost sorry I quarrelled with him on your account. He
   looks at me coldly now, he is remembering my American blood,
   despising it. And to think I have lost the priceless regard of
   Burden for a man who can eat boiled and tired cod, masked with egg
   sauce, washed down with ginger beer!
 
   Where was I? The sculpture at the British Museum; then the next day
   at the National Gallery. Our spirits kneeled there; we grew small.
   No, we didn’t, I’m disingenuous. We said so, not meaning it in the
   least. After twenty minutes we forgot all about the pictures.
   Rumpelmayer’s, St. James’s Park, out to Coombe.
 
   Did you realise we were seeing each other every day, how much time
   we spent together?
 
   Am I eighteen or twenty-eight? You’ve a reputation for knowing more
   about Greek roots than any other Englishman. Should I have run away
   down here if you had talked about Greek roots? I’m excited,
   exhausted, bewildered. For three nights sleep failed me. Nothing is
   so wonderful as a perfect friendship between a man of your age and a
   woman of mine. Why did you change your mind, or your note, so
   quickly yesterday? _I_ knew all the time what was happening to us. I
   think there is something arrogant in your humility. I am naturally
   so much more outspoken than you, although my troubles have made me
   more fearful. You are a strange man. I think you may send me a
   portrait. When I try to recall you, you don’t always come whole,
   only bits of you, inconsistent bits, a gleam of humour in your eyes,
   your stoop, the height that makes us so incongruous together. I like
   you, Gabriel Stanton, and I’ve run away from you; that’s the truth.
   That disingenuous aggressive humility of yours is a subtle appeal to
   my sympathies. I don’t want to sympathise with you overmuch, with
   the loneliness of your life, or anything about you. We were meeting
   too often, talking too freely. I curl up and want to hide when I
   think of some of the things we have said (_I_ have said!!!). I know
   I am too impulsive.
 
   I’m going to settle down here and start seriously on my
   Staffordshire Potters. I’ve taken the house for three months. If I
   had not already written the longest letter ever penned I’d describe
   it to you. Perhaps I’ll write again if you encourage me. Think of me
   as a novelist out of work, using up my MS. paper. Down here
   everything has become unreal. You and I, but especially “_us_”! I
   _want_ everything to be unreal, I’m not strong enough for more
   reality. Keep unsubstantial. I don’t suppose you will understand me
   (I am not sure that I understand myself). But you begged me to “let
   myself go,” “pour myself out on you.” Can I take your strength and
   lean upon it, the tenderness you promise me and revel in it, all
   that I believe you are offering me, and give you nothing? I am mean,
   afraid of giving. It all came so quickly, so unexpectedly. I have
   never had a real companion. Never, never, never even as a child been
   wholly natural with anybody, posing always. The only daughter of a
   millionaire with more talent than she ought to have, a shy soul
   behind a brazen forehead, is in a difficult position. To undrape
   that shy soul of mine as you so nearly make me do, unwillingly—but
   it might happen—makes me shiver. That’s why I ran away, I want to be
   isolated, to stand alone. Here is the truth again, not at the bottom
   of a well, but at the end of an interminable letter. I am afraid of
   pain, and this intimacy presages it. You cannot be all I think you.
   I don’t want to be near enough to see your clay feet.
 
   I am going to get some picture postcards with small space for
   writing; this MS. paper demoralises me.
 
                                                Sincerely,
                                                        MARGARET CAPEL.
 
   No. 15.
 
   Will you ever know what your dear wonderful letter has given me? I
   passed through moments of doubt, of bewildered unbelief into a
   golden trance of joy and hope. And as again and again I read it some
   of your far braver personality fills me, and I refuse to think this
   new spring of hope is a mere dream, and take courage and tell myself
   I _am_ something to you—something in your life, and that to me,
   Gabriel Stanton, has come at last the chance of helping, tending,
   caring for against all the world if need be, such a woman as
   Margaret Capel.
 
   Let me revel in this new strange happiness. You are too kind, too
   generous to destroy it! For it is all strange and marvellous to
   me—I’ve lived so much alone—have missed so much by circumstance and
   the fault of what you call my “aggressive humility.” I _can_ help
   you! As I write I feel I want nothing else in life. Oh! my wonderful
   friend, don’t let us miss a relationship which on my part I swear to
   you shall be consecrated to your service, to your happiness in any
   and every way you decide or will ask. Let me come into your life,
   give me the chance of healing those wounds which have bruised you
   grievously, but can never conquer your brave spirit. You must let me
   help.
 
   You have gone away, but your dear letter is with me—it is so much
   your letter—so much you that I am not even lonely any more. And yet
   I long to see you—hear you talk, be near you. Thoughts—hopes—ideas,
   crowd upon me tonight, things to tell you——It is like having a new
   sense—I’ve wakened up in a new and so beautiful country. Do you wish
   for those weeks of solitude? Only what you wish matters. But I
   confess I’ve looked up the trains to Pineland. I will come on any
   day at any moment you say. There is no duty that could keep me
   should you say “come.” Give me at least one chance of seeing you in
   your new home. Then I will keep away and respect your solitude if
   you wish it.
 
   The joy of your letter and the golden castles I am building help the
   hours until I hear from you.
 
                                                                  G. S.
 
 It is my opinion still that she only ran away in order to bring him
 after her, to secure a greater solitude than they could enjoy in places
 of public resort, or in her father’s house. I don’t mean that she
 deliberately planned what followed, but had that been her intention she
 could have devised no better strategy than to leave him at the point at
 which they had arrived without a word of farewell other than that
 letter. As for me, when I had finished reading it and the answer, I had
 recourse to the diary and MS. notes. They would, however, have been of
 but little use had not a second dose of codein that night brought me
 again in closer relation with the writer.
 
 
 
 
                                CHAPTER VI
 
 
 As I said, I took two codein pills instead of one that night, and in an
 hour or so was conscious of the comfort and phantasmagoria of morphia. I
 was no longer in the bedroom of which I had tired, nor in the rough
 garden without trees or shade. I had escaped from these and in returning
 health was beside the sea, happily listening to the little waves
 breaking on the stones, no soul in sight but those two, Margaret Capel
 and Gabriel Stanton, in earnest talk that came to me as I sat with my
 back against a rock, the salt wind in my face. How it was they did not
 see me and moderate their voices I do not know, morphia gives one these
 little lapses and surprises.
 
 Margaret looked extraordinarily sedate and yet perverse, her thin lips
 pink and eyes dancing. I saw the incandescent effect of which Peter
 Kennedy had told me. It was not only her eyes that were alight but the
 woman herself, the luminous fair skin and the fairness of her hair
 stirred and brightened by the sun and the sea-wind. She talked vividly,
 whilst he sat at her feet listening intently, offering her the homage of
 his softened angularities, his abandoned scholarship, his adoring eyes.
 
 “Why did you come? I told you not to come. Of course I meant to wire in
 answer to your letter that you were to stay in London. What was the use
 of my running away?”
 
 I saw that he fingered the hem of her skirt, and watched her all the
 time she spoke.
 
 “Tomorrow I shall have no expectation in the post. I hate not to care
 whether my letters come or not. And Monday too. You have spoiled two
 mornings for me.”
 
 “I am not as satisfying as my letters to you.” Even his voice was
 changed, the musical charming Stanton voice. His had deepened and there
 was the note of an organ in it. She looked at him critically or
 caressingly.
 
 “Not quite, not yet. I understand your letters better than I do you. And
 you are never twice alike, not quite alike. We part as friends,
 intimates. Then we come together again and you are almost a stranger; we
 have to begin all over again.”
 
 “I am sorry.” He looked perplexed. “How do I change or vary? I cannot
 bear to think that you should look upon me as a stranger.”
 
 “Only for a few moments.”
 
 “When you met me at the station today?”
 
 “I was at the station early, and then was vexed I had come, looking
 about me to see if there were any one I knew or who knew me. I took
 refuge at the bookstall, found ‘The Immoralists’ among the two-shilling
 soiled.” She left off abruptly, and her face clouded.
 
 “Don’t!” he whispered.
 
 “How quick you are!” Now their hands met. She smiled and went on
 talking. “I heard a click and saw that the signals were down. The train
 rounded the curve and came in slowly. People descended; I was conscious
 of half a dozen, although I saw but one. No, I didn’t see you, only your
 covert coat and felt hat. I felt a pang of disappointment.” Their hands
 fell apart. I saw he was hurt. She may have seen it too, but made no
 sign.
 
 “It was not your fault, you had done nothing ... you just were not as I
 expected you. You had cut yourself shaving, for one thing.” He put his
 hand to his chin involuntarily, there was barely a scratch. “As we
 walked back from the station my heart felt quite dead and cold. I hated
 the scratch on your cheek, the shape of your hat, everything.” He turned
 pale. “I wondered how I was going to bear two whole days, what I should
 say to you.”
 
 “We talked!”
 
 “I know, but it was outside talk, forced, laboured. You remember, ‘How
 warm the weather was in London’; and that the train was not too full for
 comfort. You had papers in your hand, the _Saturday Review_, the
 _Spectator_. You spoke of an article by Runciman in the first.”
 
 “You seemed interested.”
 
 “I was thinking how we were going to get through the two days. What I
 had ever seen in you, why I thought I liked you so much.”
 
 He was quite dumb by now, the sunken eyes were full of pain, the
 straight austere mouth was only a line; he no longer touched the hem of
 her dress.
 
 “You left me in the garden of the hotel when you went to book a room, to
 leave your bag. I sat on a seat in the garden and looked at the sea, the
 blue wonder of the sea, the jagged coast-line, and one rock that stood
 out, then hills and always more hills, the sky so blue, spring in the
 air. Gabriel ...” she leaned forward, touched him lightly on the
 shoulder. A deep flush came over his face, but he did not move nor put
 up his hand to take hers. “You were only gone ten minutes. I could not
 have borne for you to have been away longer. There were a thousand
 things I wanted to say to you, that I knew I could say to no one but
 you. About the spring and my heart hunger, what it meant.”
 
 “And when I came out I suppose all you remembered was that I had cut
 myself shaving?”
 
 She seemed astonished at the bitterness of his tone.
 
 “You are not angry with me, are you?”
 
 “No! Not angry. How could I be?”
 
 “When you came out and I felt rather than saw you were moving toward me
 across the grass I thought of nothing but that you were coming; that we
 were going to have tea together, on the ricketty iron table, that I
 should pour it out for you. That after that we should walk here
 together, and then you would go home with me, dine together at Carbies,
 talk and talk and talk....”
 
 He could not help taking her hand again, because she gave it to him, but
 his face was set and serious.
 
 “Tell me, is it the same with you as it is with me? Am I a stranger to
 you sometimes? Different from what you expect? Do I disappoint you, and
 leave you cold, almost as if you disliked me? Don’t answer. I expect, I
 know it is the same with you. You find me plain, gone off, you wonder
 what you ever saw in me.”
 
 He answered with a quiet yet passionate sincerity:
 
 “When I see you after an interval my heart rushes out to you, my pulses
 leap. I feel myself growing pale. I am paralysed and devoid of words.
 Margaret! My very soul breathes _Margaret_, my wonderful Margaret. I
 cannot get my breath.” Her eyes shone and exulted.
 
 “It is not like that always?” she whispered, leaning towards him.
 
 “It is like that always. But today it was more than that. I had not seen
 you for a week, a whole long week. Sometimes in that week I had not
 dared look forward.”
 
 “And then you saw me.” She was hanging upon his words. He got up
 abruptly and walked a few paces away from her, to the edge of the sea.
 She smiled quietly to herself when he left her like that. He was
 suffering, he could not bear the contrast between what she had thought
 of him and he of her.
 
 “Gabriel!” she called him back presently, called softly and he came
 swiftly.
 
 “I had better go back to town by the next train. I disappoint you.”
 
 “Silly!” She was amazingly, alluringly smiling into his dour eyes, not
 satisfied until he smiled too. “It is my sense of style. I am like
 grammar; all moods and tenses. You want me to tell you everything, don’t
 you?”
 
 “Am I the man for you? that is what I want you to tell me. I don’t know
 what you mean by that sense of strangeness—I cannot bear it.”
 
 “Don’t you vary? wonder, doubt?”
 
 “I always knew from the first afternoon when you were shown into my room
 in Greyfriars’, your black fur framing your exquisite porcelain face,
 your eyes like wavering stars, that you were the only woman in the
 world. Since then the conviction of it grows deeper and deeper, more
 certain. You are never out of my mind. I know I am not good enough for
 you, too old and grave. But you have let me hope. Oh! you wonderful
 child.” For still she was smiling at him in that dazzling alluring way.
 He was at her feet and the hem of her dress again against his lips.
 “Don’t you understand, can’t I make you understand? I adore you, I
 worship you. I want nothing from you except that you let me tell you so
 sometimes.”
 
 “It is so much nicer when you write it,” she murmured.
 
 “Don’t.” She cajoled him.
 
 “I can’t take it lightly,” he burst out. “Pity me, forgive me, but don’t
 laugh at me.”
 
 “I am not laughing.”
 
 “I know. You are an angel of sweetness, goodness. Margaret, let me love
 you!”

 I was back again in bed, very drowsy and comfortable, wondering how I
 had got there, what had happened, what time it was. I took a drink of
 lemonade and thought what a bad night I was having. I remembered my
 dream; it had been very vivid, and I was sorry for Gabriel Stanton and
 tried to remember what had become of him, when I had heard of or seen
 him last; it must have been a long time ago. Margaret was a minx. If
 ever I wrote about them it would be to tell the truth, to analyse and
 expose the spirit and soul of a woman flirt. And again when I lay down I
 thought of what the critics would say of this fine and intimate study,
 this human document that I was to give the world. Phrases came to me,
 vivid lightning touches ... I hoped I should be able to remember them,
 but hardly doubted it, for others came, even better than these, and then
 in consequence, sleep....

 Benham said in the morning:
 
 “Whatever did you take another pill for? Was anything the matter with
 you? You could have called me up.”
 
 “But you might have argued with me.”
 
 “I am sure I don’t know what good a nurse is to you at all!”
 
 “You would be invaluable if you would only get it into your head that I
 am not a mental case. Don’t you realise that I am a very clever woman,
 quite as clever as you?”
 
 “I don’t call it clever to retard your own recovery.”
",Twilight
18," him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled
 several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s
 ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will
 begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”
 
 “What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”
 
 “Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as
 far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within
 ear-shot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever
 it was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly
 Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a
 strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him
 at Boscombe Pool was some one who had been in Australia.”
 
 “What of the rat, then?”
 
 Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it
 out on the table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said.
 “I wired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of
 the map. “What do you read?” he asked.
 
 “ARAT,” I read.
 
 “And now?” He raised his hand.
 
 “BALLARAT.”
 
 “Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only
 caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his
 murderer. So-and-so, of Ballarat.”
 
 “It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.
 
 “It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
 considerably. The possession of a gray garment was a third point
 which, granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We
 have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an
 Australian from Ballarat with a gray cloak.”
 
 “Certainly.”
 
 “And one who was at home in the district, for the Pool can only be
 approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly
 wander.”
 
 “Quite so.”
 
 “Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I
 gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as
 to the personality of the criminal.”
 
 “But how did you gain them?”
 
 “You know my method. It is founded upon the observance of trifles.”
 
 “His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his
 stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”
 
 “Yes, they were peculiar boots.”
 
 “But his lameness?”
 
 “The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his
 left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”
 
 “But his left-handedness.”
 
 “You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
 by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately
 behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it
 were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the
 interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found
 the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enabled
 me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some
 attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140
 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found
 the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
 where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which
 are rolled in Rotterdam.”
 
 “And the cigar-holder?”
 
 “I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used
 a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not
 a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.”
 
 “Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he
 cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as
 if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in
 which all this points. The culprit is—”
 
 “Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our
 sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
 
 The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,
 limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,
 and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous
 limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and
 of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding,
 drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his
 appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the
 corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear
 to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic
 disease.
 
 “Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes, gently. “You had my note?”
 
 “Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see
 me here to avoid scandal.”
 
 “I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”
 
 “And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with
 despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.
 
 “Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is
 so. I know all about McCarthy.”
 
 The old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I
 would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that
 I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”
 
 “I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes, gravely.
 
 “I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would
 break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am
 arrested.”
 
 “It may not come to that,” said Holmes.
 
 “What!”
 
 “I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who
 required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young
 McCarthy must be got off, however.”
 
 “I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My
 doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would
 rather die under my own roof than in a jail.”
 
 Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a
 bundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I
 shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness
 it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save
 young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is
 absolutely needed.”
 
 “It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live
 to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare
 Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has
 been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.
 
 “You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I
 tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.
 His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my
 life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
 
 “It was in the early sixties at the diggings. I was a young chap then,
 hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got
 among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to
 the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway
 robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,
 sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the
 road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,
 and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
 
 “One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we
 lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of
 us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at
 the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we
 got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was
 this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then,
 but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face,
 as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became
 wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.
 There I parted from my old pals, and determined to settle down to a
 quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be
 in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,
 to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and
 though my wife died young, she left me my dear little Alice. Even when
 she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path
 as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf, and
 did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy
 laid his grip upon me.
 
 “I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent
 Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.
 
 “‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as
 good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can
 have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country
 is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’
 
 “Well, down they came to the West country, there was no shaking them
 off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.
 There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I
 would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse
 as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my
 past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever
 it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last
 he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
 
 “His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known
 to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad
 should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not
 have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to
 the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.
 McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at
 the Pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
 
 “When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked
 a cigar, and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I
 listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to
 come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as
 little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off
 the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most
 dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the
 bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind
 and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my
 memory and my girl! Both could be saved, if I could but silence that
 foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I
 have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that
 my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
 than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if
 he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;
 but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back
 to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true
 story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”
 
 “Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes, as the old man
 signed the statement which had been drawn out. “I pray that we may
 never be exposed to such a temptation.”
 
 “I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?”
 
 “In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will
 soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes.
 I will keep your confession, and, if McCarthy is condemned, I shall be
 forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and
 your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”
 
 “Farewell, then,” said the old man, solemnly. “Your own death-beds,
 when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which
 you have given to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame,
 he stumbled slowly from the room.
 
 “God help us!” said Holmes, after a long silence. “Why does fate play
 such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as
 this that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for
 the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”
 
 James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes, on the strength of a
 number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes, and submitted
 to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our
 interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son
 and daughter may come to live happily together, in ignorance of the
 black cloud which rests upon their past.
 
 
 
 
 Adventure V
 
 THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
 
 
 When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases
 between the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present
 strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know
 which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained
 publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field
 for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a
 degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,
 too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,
 beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially
 cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture
 and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
 him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in
 its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give
 some account of it, in spite of the fact that there are points in
 connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,
 entirely cleared up.
 
 The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
 or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings
 under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of
 the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a
 luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the
 facts connected with the loss of the British bark _Sophy Anderson_, of
 the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa,
 and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may
 be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s
 watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
 therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction
 which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these
 I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such
 singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have
 now taken up my pen to describe.
 
 It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had
 set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the
 rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart
 of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the
 instant from the routine of life, and to recognize the presence of
 those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars
 of his civilization, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in,
 the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a
 child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
 fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was
 deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories, until the howl of the
 gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the
 rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was
 on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once
 more in my old quarters at Baker Street.
 
 “Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell.
 Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”
 
 “Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage
 visitors.”
 
 “A client, then?”
 
 “If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on
 such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to
 be some crony of the landlady’s.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came
 a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his
 long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant
 chair upon which a new-comer must sit. “Come in!” said he.
 
 The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,
 well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy
 in his bearing. The steaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and
 his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he
 had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and
 I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a
 man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.
 
 “I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden _pince-nez_ to his
 eyes. “I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some
 traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”
 
 “Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here
 on the hook, and will be dry presently. You have come up from the
 south-west, I see.”
 
 “Yes, from Horsham.”
 
 “That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe-caps is quite
 distinctive.”
 
 “I have come for advice.”
 
 “That is easily got.”
 
 “And help.”
 
 “That is not always so easy.”
 
 “I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how
 you saved him in the Tankerville Club Scandal.”
 
 “Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”
 
 “He said that you could solve anything.”
 
 “He said too much.”
 
 “That you are never beaten.”
 
 “I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a
 woman.”
 
 “But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”
 
 “It is true that I have been generally successful.”
 
 “Then you may be so with me.”
 
 “I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire, and favor me with
 some details as to your case.”
 
 “It is no ordinary one.”
 
 “None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”
 
 “And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have
 ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events
 than those which have happened in my own family.”
 
 “You fill me with interest,” said Holmes. “Pray give us the essential
 facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to
 those details which seem to me to be most important.”
 
 The young man pulled his chair up, and pushed his wet feet out towards
 the blaze.
 
 “My name,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far
 as I can understand it, little to do with this awful business. It is an
 hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must
 go back to the commencement of the affair.
 
 “You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and
 my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which
 he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was the
 patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with
 such success that he was able to sell it, and to retire upon a handsome
 competence.
 
 “My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man, and
 became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done
 very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and
 afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid
 down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained
 for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe,
 and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very
 considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was
 his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy
 in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and
 quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most
 retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham I
 doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three
 fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though
 very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank
 a great deal of brandy, and smoked very heavily, but he would see no
 society, and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.
 
 “He didn’t mind me, in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time
 when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be
 in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He
 begged my father to let me live with him, and he was very kind to me
 in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon
 and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with
 the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was
 sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys, and could
 go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him
 in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had
 a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably
 locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to
 enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the key-hole, but
 I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and
 bundles as would be expected in such a room.
 
 “One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay
 upon the table in front of the Colonel’s plate. It was not a common
 thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in
 ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he,
 as he took it up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening
 it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which
 pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh
 was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen,
 his eyes were protruding, his skin the color of putty, and he glared at
 the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand. ‘K. K. K.!’ he
 shrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’
 
 “‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.
 
 “‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,
 leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope, and saw
 scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter
 K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried
 pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the
 breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with
 an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,
 and a small brass box, like a cash-box, in the other.
 
 “‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he,
 with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,
 and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’
 
 “I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step
 up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there
 was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass
 box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,
 with a start, that upon the lid were printed the treble K which I had
 read in the morning upon the envelope.
 
 “‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave
 my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my
 brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you
 can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my
 advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to
 give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are
 going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’
 
 “I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.
 The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression
 upon me, and I pondered over it, and turned it every way in my mind
 without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off
 the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation
 grew less keen as the weeks passed, and nothing happened to disturb
 the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle,
 however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any
 sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the
 door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort
 of drunken frenzy, and would burst out of the house and tear about the
 garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid
 of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen,
 by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush
 tumultuously in at the door, and lock and bar it behind him, like a man
 who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the
 roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold
 day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.
 
 “Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse
 your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken
 sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to
 search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay
 at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the
 water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his
 known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of suicide. But I, who knew
 how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade
 myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
 however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of
 some £14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”
 
 “One moment,” Holmes interposed. “Your statement is, I foresee, one
 of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the
 date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his
 supposed suicide.”
 
 “The latter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,
 upon the night of May 2d.”
 
 “Thank you. Pray proceed.”
 
 “When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made
 a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We
 found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On
 the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.
 K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’
 written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers
 which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
 nothing of much importance in the attic, save a great many scattered
 papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some
 of them were of the war time, and showed that he had done his duty
 well, and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a
 date during the reconstruction of the Southern States, and were mostly
 concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in
 opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the
 North.
 
 “Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at
 Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January
 of ’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a
 sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There
 he was, sitting with a newly-opened envelope in one hand and five dried
 orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always
 laughed at what he called my cock-and-a-bull story about the Colonel,
 but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come
 upon himself.
 
 “‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.
 
 “My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.
 
 “He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the
 very letters. But what is this written above them?’
 
 “‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.
 
 “‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.
 
 “‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the
 papers must be those that are destroyed.’
 
 “‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilized
 land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the
 thing come from?’
 
 “‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the post-mark.
 
 “‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with
 sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’
 
 “‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.
 
 “‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’
 
 “‘Then let me do so?’
 
 “‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’
 
 “It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I
 went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.
 
 “On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from
 home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command
 of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,
 for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away
 from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his
 absence I received a telegram from the Major, imploring me to come at
 once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound
 in the neighborhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I
 hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his
 consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in
 the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit
 unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘Death
 from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected
 with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the
 idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
 robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And
 yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I
 was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
 
 “In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why
 I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that
 our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s
 life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in
 another.
 
 “It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years
 and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived
 happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed
 away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I
 had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow
 fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”
 
 The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and, turning
 to the table, he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.
 
 “This is the envelope,” he continued. “The post-mark is London—eastern
 division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last
 message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”
 
 “What have you done?” asked Holmes.
 
 “Nothing.”
 
",Holmes
19," gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:
 
 “A beadle. A parish beadle, or I’ll eat my head.”
 
 “Pray don’t interrupt just now,” said Mr. Brownlow. “Take a seat, will
 you?”
 
 Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.
 Grimwig’s manner. Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an
 uninterrupted view of the beadle’s countenance; and said, with a little
 impatience,
 
 “Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?”
 
 “Yes, sir,” said Mr. Bumble.
 
 “And you ARE a beadle, are you not?” inquired Mr. Grimwig.
 
 “I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,” rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.
 
 “Of course,” observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, “I knew he was.
 A beadle all over!”
 
 Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and
 resumed:
 
 “Do you know where this poor boy is now?”
 
 “No more than nobody,” replied Mr. Bumble.
 
 “Well, what _do_ you know of him?” inquired the old gentleman. “Speak
 out, my friend, if you have anything to say. What _do_ you know of
 him?”
 
 “You don’t happen to know any good of him, do you?” said Mr. Grimwig,
 caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble’s features.
 
 Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with
 portentous solemnity.
 
 “You see?” said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.
 
 Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble’s pursed-up
 countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding
 Oliver, in as few words as possible.
 
 Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms;
 inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments’
 reflection, commenced his story.
 
 It would be tedious if given in the beadle’s words: occupying, as it
 did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of
 it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.
 That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than
 treachery, ingratitude, and malice. That he had terminated his brief
 career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly
 attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from
 his master’s house. In proof of his really being the person he
 represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had
 brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow’s
 observations.
 
 “I fear it is all too true,” said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after
 looking over the papers. “This is not much for your intelligence; but I
 would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable
 to the boy.”
 
 It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this
 information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have
 imparted a very different colouring to his little history. It was too
 late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and,
 pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.
 
 Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so
 much disturbed by the beadle’s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to
 vex him further.
 
 At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.
 
 “Mrs. Bedwin,” said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; “that
 boy, Oliver, is an imposter.”
 
 “It can’t be, sir. It cannot be,” said the old lady energetically.
 
 “I tell you he is,” retorted the old gentleman. “What do you mean by
 can’t be? We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and
 he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.”
 
 “I never will believe it, sir,” replied the old lady, firmly. “Never!”
 
 “You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying
 story-books,” growled Mr. Grimwig. “I knew it all along. Why didn’t you
 take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn’t had a fever, I
 suppose, eh? He was interesting, wasn’t he? Interesting! Bah!” And Mr.
 Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.
 
 “He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,” retorted Mrs. Bedwin,
 indignantly. “I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty
 years; and people who can’t say the same, shouldn’t say anything about
 them. That’s my opinion!”
 
 This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor. As it extorted
 nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head,
 and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was
 stopped by Mr. Brownlow.
 
 “Silence!” said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from
 feeling. “Never let me hear the boy’s name again. I rang to tell you
 that. Never. Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room, Mrs.
 Bedwin. Remember! I am in earnest.”
 
 There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow’s that night.
 
 Oliver’s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it
 was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it
 might have broken outright.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XVIII.
 HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE
 FRIENDS
 
 
 About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to
 pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of
 reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of
 which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary
 extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious
 friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so
 much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin
 laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and
 cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished
 with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young
 lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel
 circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing
 a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be
 hanged at the Old Bailey one morning. Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal
 his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that
 the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in
 question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of
 certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true,
 was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few
 select friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable
 picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and
 politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never
 be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation.
 
 Little Oliver’s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew’s words, and
 imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them. That it was
 possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the
 guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and
 that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or
 over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by
 the Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely,
 when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that
 gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some
 foregone conspiracy of the kind. As he glanced timidly up, and met the
 Jew’s searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs
 were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.
 
 The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that
 if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they
 would be very good friends yet. Then, taking his hat, and covering
 himself with an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the
 room-door behind him.
 
 And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many
 subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and
 left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts. Which,
 never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must
 long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed.
 
 After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked;
 and he was at liberty to wander about the house.
 
 It was a very dirty place. The rooms upstairs had great high wooden
 chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the
 ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were
 ornamented in various ways. From all of these tokens Oliver concluded
 that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to
 better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and
 dreary as it looked now.
 
 Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings;
 and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would
 scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes. With
 these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living
 thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from
 room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the
 street-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain
 there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys
 returned.
 
 In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars
 which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which
 was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which
 made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows. There
 was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter;
 and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours
 together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and
 crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.
 Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the
 parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again;
 and as the window of Oliver’s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed
 with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make
 out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any
 attempt to be seen or heard,—which he had as much chance of being, as
 if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul’s Cathedral.
 
 One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that
 evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to
 evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him
 justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with
 this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in
 his toilet, straightway.
 
 Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some
 faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those
 about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the
 way of this proposal. So he at once expressed his readiness; and,
 kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he
 could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which
 Mr. Dawkins designated as “japanning his trotter-cases.” The phrase,
 rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots.
 
 Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational
 animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy
 attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and
 having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of
 having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to
 disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco
 that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer
 that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce,
 with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature.
 He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief
 space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said,
 half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:
 
 “What a pity it is he isn’t a prig!”
 
 “Ah!” said Master Charles Bates; “he don’t know what’s good for him.”
 
 The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates.
 They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.
 
 “I suppose you don’t even know what a prig is?” said the Dodger
 mournfully.
 
 “I think I know that,” replied Oliver, looking up. “It’s a the—; you’re
 one, are you not?” inquired Oliver, checking himself.
 
 “I am,” replied the Dodger. “I’d scorn to be anything else.” Mr.
 Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment,
 and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged
 by his saying anything to the contrary.
 
 “I am,” repeated the Dodger. “So’s Charley. So’s Fagin. So’s Sikes.
 So’s Nancy. So’s Bet. So we all are, down to the dog. And he’s the
 downiest one of the lot!”
 
 “And the least given to peaching,” added Charley Bates.
 
 “He wouldn’t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing
 himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without
 wittles for a fortnight,” said the Dodger.
 
 “Not a bit of it,” observed Charley.
 
 “He’s a rum dog. Don’t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs
 or sings when he’s in company!” pursued the Dodger. “Won’t he growl at
 all, when he hears a fiddle playing! And don’t he hate other dogs as
 ain’t of his breed! Oh, no!”
 
 “He’s an out-and-out Christian,” said Charley.
 
 This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal’s abilities, but it
 was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only
 known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to
 be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes’ dog, there
 exist strong and singular points of resemblance.
 
 “Well, well,” said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they
 had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced
 all his proceedings. “This hasn’t go anything to do with young Green
 here.”
 
 “No more it has,” said Charley. “Why don’t you put yourself under
 Fagin, Oliver?”
 
 “And make your fortun’ out of hand?” added the Dodger, with a grin.
 
 “And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I
 mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the
 forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,” said Charley Bates.
 
 “I don’t like it,” rejoined Oliver, timidly; “I wish they would let me
 go. I—I—would rather go.”
 
 “And Fagin would _rather_ not!” rejoined Charley.
 
 Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to
 express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his
 boot-cleaning.
 
 “Go!” exclaimed the Dodger. “Why, where’s your spirit?” Don’t you take
 any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your
 friends?”
 
 “Oh, blow that!” said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk
 handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,
 “that’s too mean; that is.”
 
 “_I_ couldn’t do it,” said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.
 
 “You can leave your friends, though,” said Oliver with a half smile;
 “and let them be punished for what you did.”
 
 “That,” rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, “That was all out
 of consideration for Fagin, ’cause the traps know that we work
 together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn’t made our
 lucky; that was the move, wasn’t it, Charley?”
 
 Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection
 of Oliver’s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was
 inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and
 down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping,
 about five minutes long.
 
 “Look here!” said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and
 halfpence. “Here’s a jolly life! What’s the odds where it comes from?
 Here, catch hold; there’s plenty more where they were took from. You
 won’t, won’t you? Oh, you precious flat!”
 
 “It’s naughty, ain’t it, Oliver?” inquired Charley Bates. “He’ll come
 to be scragged, won’t he?”
 
 “I don’t know what that means,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Something in this way, old feller,” said Charly. As he said it, Master
 Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the
 air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound
 through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic
 representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.
 
 “That’s what it means,” said Charley. “Look how he stares, Jack!
 
 I never did see such prime company as that ’ere boy; he’ll be the death
 of me, I know he will.” Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily
 again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.
 
 “You’ve been brought up bad,” said the Dodger, surveying his boots with
 much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. “Fagin will make
 something of you, though, or you’ll be the first he ever had that
 turned out unprofitable. You’d better begin at once; for you’ll come to
 the trade long before you think of it; and you’re only losing time,
 Oliver.”
 
 Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his
 own: which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched
 into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the
 life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the
 best thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin’s favour without more
 delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.
 
 “And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,” said the Dodger, as the Jew
 was heard unlocking the door above, “if you don’t take fogels and
 tickers—”
 
 “What’s the good of talking in that way?” interposed Master Bates; “he
 don’t know what you mean.”
 
 “If you don’t take pocket-handkechers and watches,” said the Dodger,
 reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver’s capacity, “some
 other cove will; so that the coves that lose ’em will be all the worse,
 and you’ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha’p’orth the
 better, except the chaps wot gets them—and you’ve just as good a right
 to them as they have.”
 
 “To be sure, to be sure!” said the Jew, who had entered unseen by
 Oliver. “It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the
 Dodger’s word for it. Ha! ha! ha! He understands the catechism of his
 trade.”
 
 The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the
 Dodger’s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his
 pupil’s proficiency.
 
 The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had
 returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver
 had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom
 Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few
 gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.
 
 Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps
 numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his
 deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that
 he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius
 and professional aquirements. He had small twinkling eyes, and a
 pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy
 fustian trousers, and an apron. His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out
 of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his
 “time” was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having
 worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow
 any attention on his private clothes. Mr. Chitling added, with strong
 marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder
 was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there
 was no remedy against the County. The same remark he considered to
 apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be
 decidedly unlawful. Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating
 that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long
 hard-working days; and that he “wished he might be busted if he warn’t
 as dry as a lime-basket.”
 
 “Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?” inquired the
 Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the
 table.
 
 “I—I—don’t know, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Who’s that?” inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at
 Oliver.
 
 “A young friend of mine, my dear,” replied the Jew.
 
 “He’s in luck, then,” said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.
 “Never mind where I came from, young ’un; you’ll find your way there,
 soon enough, I’ll bet a crown!”
 
 At this sally, the boys laughed. After some more jokes on the same
 subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.
 
 After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew
 their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and
 sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to
 interest his hearers. These were, the great advantages of the trade,
 the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the
 liberality of the Jew himself. At length these subjects displayed signs
 of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the
 house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two. Miss Betsy
 accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.
 
 From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost
 constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with
 the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver’s, Mr.
 Fagin best knew. At other times the old man would tell them stories of
 robberies he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much
 that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing
 heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better
 feelings.
 
 In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils. Having prepared
 his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the
 companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was
 now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would
 blacken it, and change its hue for ever.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XIX.
 IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON
 
 
 It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his
 great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up
 over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face:
 emerged from his den. He paused on the step as the door was locked and
 chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure,
 and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down
 the street as quickly as he could.
 
 The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of
 Whitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the
 street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck
 off in the direction of the Spitalfields.
 
 The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the
 streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and
 clammy to the touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a
 being as the Jew to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping
 beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man
 seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and
 darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of
 some rich offal for a meal.
 
 He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he
 reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon
 became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in
 that close and densely-populated quarter.
 
 The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be
 at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the
 intricacies of the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets,
 and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the
 farther end. At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having
 exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked
 upstairs.
 
 A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man’s
 voice demanded who was there.
 
 “Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,” said the Jew looking in.
 
 “Bring in your body then,” said Sikes. “Lie down, you stupid brute!
 Don’t you know the devil when he’s got a great-coat on?”
 
 Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin’s outer
 garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a
 chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his
 tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his
 nature to be.
 
 “Well!” said Sikes.
 
 “Well, my dear,” replied the Jew.—“Ah! Nancy.”
 
 The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to
 imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had
 not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. All doubts upon
 the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady’s
 behaviour. She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and
 bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold
 night, and no mistake.
 
 “It is cold, Nancy dear,” said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands
 over the fire. “It seems to go right through one,” added the old man,
 touching his side.
 
 “It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,” said
 Mr. Sikes. “Give him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make
 haste! It’s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase
 shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.”
 
 Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were
 many: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were
 filled with several kinds of liquids. Sikes pouring out a glass of
 brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.
 
 “Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,” replied the Jew, putting down the
 glass after just setting his lips to it.
 
 “What! You’re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?”
 inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. “Ugh!”
 
 With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw
 the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony
 to filling it again for himself: which he did at once.
 
 The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second
 glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a
 restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly
 furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to
 induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and
 with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three
 heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a “life-preserver” that
 hung over the chimney-piece.
 
 “There,” said Sikes, smacking his lips. “Now I’m ready.”
 
 “For business?” inquired the Jew.
 
 “For business,” replied Sikes; “so say what you’ve got to say.”
 
 “About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?” said the Jew, drawing his chair
 forward, and speaking in a very low voice.
 
 “Yes. Wot about it?” inquired Sikes.
 
 “Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,” said the Jew. “He knows what I
 mean, Nancy; don’t he?”
 
 “No, he don’t,” sneered Mr. Sikes. “Or he won’t, and that’s the same
 thing. Speak out, and call things by their right names; don’t sit
 there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you
 warn’t the very first that thought about the robbery. Wot d’ye mean?”
 
 “Hush, Bill, hush!” said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop
 this burst of indignation; “somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody
 will hear us.”
 
 “Let ’em hear!” said Sikes; “I don’t care.” But as Mr. Sikes _did_
 care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and
 grew calmer.
 
 “There, there,” said the Jew, coaxingly. “It was only my caution,
 nothing more. Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to
 be done, Bill, eh? When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such
 plate!” said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in
 a rapture of anticipation.
 
 “Not at all,” replied Sikes coldly.
 
 “Not to be done at all!” echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.
 
 “No, not at all,” rejoined Sikes. “At least it can’t be a put-up job,
 as we expected.”
 
 “Then it hasn’t been properly gone about,” said the Jew, turning pale
 with anger. “Don’t tell me!”
 
 “But I will tell you,” retorted Sikes. “Who are you that’s not to be
 told? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for
 a fortnight, and he can’t get one of the servants in line.”
 
 “Do you mean to tell me, Bill,” said the Jew: softening as the other
 grew heated: “that neither of the two men in the house can be got
 over?”
 
 “Yes, I do mean to tell you so,” replied Sikes. “The old lady has had
 ’em these twenty years; and if you were to give ’em five hundred pound,
 they wouldn’t be in it.”
 
 “But do you mean to say, my dear,” remonstrated the Jew, “that the
 women can’t be got over?”
 
 “Not a bit of it,” replied Sikes.
 
 “Not by flash Toby Crackit?” said the Jew incredulously. “Think what
 women are, Bill,”
 
 “No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,” replied Sikes. “He says he’s worn
 sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he’s been
 loitering down there, and it’s all of no use.”
 
 “He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my
 dear,” said the Jew.
 
 “So he did,” rejoined Sikes, “and they warn’t of no more use than the
 other plant.”
 
 The Jew looked blank at this information. After ruminating for some
 minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said,
 with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared
 the game was up.
 
 “And yet,” said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, “it’s a
 sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon
 it.”
 
 “So it is,” said Mr. Sikes. “Worse luck!”
 
 A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep
 thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy
 perfectly demoniacal. Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time.
 Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her
 eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.
 
 “Fagin,” said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;
 “is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it’s safely done from the
 outside?”
 
 “Yes,” said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.
 
 “Is it a bargain?” inquired Sikes.
 
 “Yes, my dear, yes,” rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every
 muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had
 awakened.
 
 “Then,” said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew’s hand, with some disdain,
 “let it come off as soon as you like. Toby and me were over the
 garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and
 shutters. The crib’s barred up at night like a jail; but there’s one
 part we can crack, safe and softly.”
 
 “Which is that, Bill?” asked the Jew eagerly.
 
 “Why,” whispered Sikes, “as you cross the lawn—”
 
 “Yes?” said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost
 starting out of it.
 
 “Umph!” cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her
 head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew’s
 face. “Never mind which part it is. You can’t do it without me, I know;
 but it’s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.”
 
 “As you like, my dear, as you like” replied the Jew. “Is there no help
 wanted, but yours and Toby’s?”
 
 “None,” said Sikes. “Cept a centre-bit and a boy. The first we’ve both
 got; the second you must find us.”
 
 “A boy!” exclaimed the Jew. “Oh! then it’s a panel, eh?”
 
 “Never mind wot it is!” replied Sikes. “I want a boy, and he musn’t be
 a big ’un. Lord!” said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, “if I’d only got that
 young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper’s! He kept him small on purpose,
 and let him out by the job. But the father gets lagged; and then the
 Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade
 where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time
 makes a ’prentice of him. And so they go on,” said Mr. Sikes, his wrath
 rising with the recollection of his wrongs, “so they go on; and, if
 they’d got money enough (which it’s a Providence they haven’t,) we
 shouldn’t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or
 two.”
 
 “No more we should,” acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering
 during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. “Bill!”
 
 “What now?” inquired Sikes.
 
 The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the
 fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave
 the room. Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought
 the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting
 Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.
 
 “You don’t want any beer,” said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining
 her seat very composedly.
 
 “I tell you I do!” replied Sikes.
 
 “Nonsense,” rejoined the girl coolly, “Go on, Fagin. I know what he’s
 going to say, Bill; he needn’t mind me.”
 
 The Jew still hesitated. Sikes looked from one to the other in some
 surprise.
 
 “Why, you don’t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?” he asked at length.
 “You’ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil’s in it. She
 ain’t one to blab. Are you Nancy?”
 
 “_I_ should think not!” replied the young lady: drawing her chair up to
 the table, and putting her elbows upon it.
 
 “No, no, my dear, I know you’re not,” said the Jew; “but—” and again
 the old man paused.
 
 “But wot?” inquired Sikes.
 
 “I didn’t know whether she mightn’t p’r’aps be out of sorts, you know,
 my dear, as she was the other night,” replied the Jew.
 
 At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing
 a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst
 into sundry exclamations of “Keep the game a-going!” “Never say die!”
 and the like. These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both
 gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and
 resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.
 
 “Now, Fagin,” said Nancy with a laugh. “Tell Bill at once, about
 Oliver!”
 
 “Ha! you’re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!” said
 the Jew, patting her on the neck. “It _was_ about Oliver I was going to
 speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 “What about him?” demanded Sikes.
 
 “He’s the boy for you, my dear,” replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper;
 laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.
 
 “He!” exclaimed Sikes.
 
 “Have him, Bill!” said Nancy. “I would, if I was in your place. He
 mayn’t be so much up, as any of the others; but that’s not what you
 want, if he’s only to open a door for you. Depend upon it he’s a safe
 one, Bill.”
 
 “I know he is,” rejoined Fagin. “He’s been in good training these last
 few weeks, and it’s time he began to work for his bread. Besides, the
 others are all too big.”
 
 “Well, he is just the size I want,” said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.
 
 “And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,” interposed the Jew;
 “he can’t help himself. That is, if you frighten him enough.”
 
 “Frighten him!” echoed Sikes. “It’ll be no sham frightening, mind you.
 If there’s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in
 for a penny, in for a pound. You won’t see him alive again, Fagin.
 Think of that, before you send him. Mark my words!” said the robber,
 poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.
 
 “I’ve thought of it all,” said the Jew with energy. “I’ve—I’ve had my
 eye upon him, my dears, close—close. Once let him feel that he is one
 of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and
 he’s ours! Ours for his life. Oho! It couldn’t have come about better!”
 The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and
 shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.
 
 “Ours!” said Sikes. “Yours, you mean.”
 
 “Perhaps I do, my dear,” said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. “Mine, if
 you like, Bill.”
 
 “And wot,” said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, “wot
 makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know
 there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you
 might pick and choose from?”
 
 “Because they’re of no use to me, my dear,” replied the Jew, with some
 confusion, “not worth the taking. Their looks convict ’em when they get
 into trouble, and I lose ’em all. With this boy, properly managed, my
 dears, I could do what I couldn’t with twenty of them. Besides,” said
 the Jew, recovering his self-possession, “he has us now if he could
 only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us.
 Never mind how he came there; it’s quite enough for my power over him
 that he was in a robbery; that’s all I want. Now, how much better this
 is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way—which
 would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.”
 
 “When is it to be done?” asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent
 exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with
 which he received Fagin’s affectation of humanity.
 
 “Ah, to be sure,” said the Jew; “when is it to be done, Bill?”
 
 “I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,” rejoined Sikes in a
 surly voice, “if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.”
 
 “Good,” said the Jew; “there’s no moon.”
 
 “No,” rejoined Sikes.
 
 “It’s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?” asked the Jew.
 
 Sikes nodded.
 
 “And about—”
 
 “Oh, ah, it’s all planned,” rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. “Never
 mind particulars. You’d better bring the boy here to-morrow night. I
 shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak. Then you hold your
 tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that’s all you’ll have to
 do.”
 
 After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was
 decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew’s next evening when the
 night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily
 observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would
 be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in
 his behalf, than anybody else. It was also solemnly arranged that poor
 Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be
 unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;
 and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought
 fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or
 evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to
 render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by
 Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and
 corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash
 Toby Crackit.
 
 These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a
 furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner;
 yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song,
 mingled with wild execrations. At length, in a fit of professional
 enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools:
 which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of
 explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it
 contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he
 fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.
 
 “Good-night, Nancy,” said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.
 
 “Good-night.”
 
 Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no
 flinching about the girl. She was as true and earnest in the matter as
 Toby Crackit himself could be.
 
 The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the
 prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped
 downstairs.
 
 “Always the way!” muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward.
 “The worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call
 up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never
 lasts. Ha! ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!”
 
 Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended
 his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger
 was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.
 
 “Is Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him,” was his first remark as they
 descended the stairs.
 
 “Hours ago,” replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. “Here he is!”
 
 The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale
 with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he
 looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in
 the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle
 spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the
 world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.
 
 “Not now,” said the Jew, turning softly away. “To-morrow. To-morrow.”
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XX.
 WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES
 
 
 When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find
 that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at
 his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was
 pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of
 his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting
 down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and
 manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the
 residence of Bill Sikes that night.
 
 “To—to—stop there, sir?” asked Oliver, anxiously.
 
 “No, no, my dear. Not to stop there,” replied the Jew. “We shouldn’t
 like to lose you. Don’t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us
 again. Ha! ha! ha! We won’t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.
 Oh no, no!”
 
 The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread,
 looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show
 that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.
 
 “I suppose,” said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, “you want to know
 what you’re going to Bill’s for—-eh, my dear?”
 
 Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been
 reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.
 
 “Why, do you think?” inquired Fagin, parrying the question.
 
 “Indeed I don’t know, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Bah!” said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from
 a close perusal of the boy’s face. “Wait till Bill tells you, then.”
 
 The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver’s not expressing any greater
 curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt
 very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of
 Fagin’s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries
 just then. He had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly
 and silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad.
 
 “You may burn a candle,” said the Jew, putting one upon the table. “And
 here’s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.
 Good-night!”
 
 “Good-night!” replied Oliver, softly.
 
 The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he
 went. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.
 
 Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to
 light it. He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table,
 saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and
 contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.
 
 “Take heed, Oliver! take heed!” said the old man, shaking his right
 hand before him in a warning manner. “He’s a rough man, and thinks
 nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing;
 and do what he bids you. Mind!” Placing a strong emphasis on the last
",OliverTwist
20," “By the way, is he coming today?”
 
 “It isn’t many days he misses.”
 
 “He comes to protect me from you, to see I have some few privileges and
 ameliorations of my condition, that my confinement is not too close, my
 gaoler too vigilant.”
 
 We understood each other better now, and I could chaff her without
 provoking anything but a difficult smile. I, of course, was a bad
 patient. I found it difficult to believe that I ought not to try and
 overcome my weakness and inertia, that it was my duty to leave off
 fighting and sink into invalidism as if it were a feather bed.
 
 That afternoon she helped me to the writing-table in the drawing-room,
 and I sat there trying to recapture the conversation I had heard. But
 although I could remember every word I found it hard to write. I could
 lie back in the chair and look at the gorse, the distant hills, the sea,
 the dim wide horizon, but to lean forward, take pen in hand, dip it in
 the ink, write, was almost beyond that still slowly ebbing strength. I
 whipped myself with the thought of what weak women had done, and dying
 men. “_My head is bloody but unbowed...._” Mine was bowed then, quickly
 over the writing-table; tears of self-pity welled hot, but I would not
 let them fall. It was not because Death was coming to me. I swear that
 then nor ever have I feared Death. But I was leaving so much undone. I
 had a place, and it was to know me no more. And the world was so lovely,
 the promise of spring in the air. When I lifted my bowed head Peter
 Kennedy was there, very pitiful as I could see by his eyes, and with a
 new gift of silence. Silence as to essentials, at least. He did not ask
 what ailed me, but spoke of a breakdown to the motor, of the wonder of
 the April weather. I soon regained my self-possession.
 
 “How soon after Margaret Capel came here did you make her acquaintance?”
 I asked him suddenly, and _à propos_ of nothing either of us had said.
 
 “It must have been a week or two, not more. I knew the house had been
 taken, but not by whom. And at first the name meant nothing to me. I am
 not a reading man; at least I don’t read novels.”
 
 “Don’t apologise. I have heard of the _Sporting Times_, _Bell’s Life_.”
 
 “Go on, gibe away, I like it. She was just the same only kinder, much
 kinder.”
 
 I laughed.
 
 “I knew she would be kind, and soft, and womanly. Didn’t she say she was
 lonely?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “And then say quickly: ‘But of course you are quite right. Reading is a
 waste of time, living everything, and you are doing a fine work, a man’s
 work in the world.’ She said she envied you. I can hear her saying it.”
 He looked ecstatic.
 
 “So can I. Ella says the same thing.”
 
 “Why are you so bitter?”
 
 I could not tell him it was because I had heard other women, many women,
 who were all things to all men, and that I despised, or perhaps envied
 them, lacking their gift and so having lived lonely save for Ella and
 Ella’s love. Until now, when it was too late. And then I looked at him,
 at Dr. Kennedy, and laughed.
 
 “Why do you laugh? You are so like and so unlike her. She would laugh
 for nothing, cry for nothing....”
 
 “Tell me all about her from the beginning.” It was an excuse to rest on
 the cushions in the easy-chair, to cease whipping my tired conscience.
 
 “There is little or nothing to tell. It was about a week after she came
 here we had the first call. _Urgent_, the message said. So I got on my
 bicycle and spun away up here. I did not even wait to get out the car.”
 
 “What day of the week was it?” I asked, interrupting him.
 
 “What day of the week?” he repeated in surprise.
 
 “Yes, what day?”
 
 “As a matter of fact it was on a Monday. What’s the point? I remember
 because it happens to have been my Infirmary day. I had just come home,
 dog-tired, but of course when the call came I had to go. I actually
 thought what a bore it was as I pedalled up. It’s nearly all uphill from
 our house to Carbies. The maid looked frightened when she opened the
 door.”
 
 “Oh, sir, I am so glad you are here. Will you please come into the
 drawing-room? Mrs. Capel, she fainted right away. Miss Stevens has tried
 hartshorn an’ burnt feathers, everything we could think of.”
 
 “Everything that had a smell?”
 
 “Yes, sir. I perceived it as I approached the drawing-room—this room.
 She was on the sofa,” he looked over to it, “very pale and dishevelled,
 only partly conscious.”
 
 “Who was Miss Stevens?”
 
 “Her maid. Quite a character. Something like your nurse, only more so.”
 
 “What did you do?”
 
 “I felt her pulse, her heart, thought of strychnine.”
 
 “You are not a great doctor, are you?” I scoffed lightly.
 
 “Oh! I know my work all right; it’s simple enough. You try this drug or
 the other....”
 
 “Or none, as in my case.”
 
 “That’s right.”
 
 “And then if the patient does not get better or her relatives get
 restive, you call in some one else, who makes another shot.” There was a
 twinkle in his eye. I always thought he knew more about medicine than he
 pretended. “And what did you do for Margaret?” I went on.
 
 “Opened the window, and her dress; waited. The first thing she said was,
 ‘Has he gone?’ I did not know to whom she referred, but the maid told me
 primly: ‘Mrs. Capel’s publisher has been down for the week-end. He left
 this morning. She don’t know what she’s saying.’ Margaret opened her
 eyes, her sweet eyes, dark-irised, the light in them wavered and grew
 strong. She seemed to recall herself with difficulty and slowly. ‘Did I
 faint? I’m all right now. Is that you, Stevens? What happened?’
 
 “‘I came in to bring your afternoon tea and you were in a dead faint, at
 the writing-table, all in a heap. I rang for cook and we carried you to
 the sofa, and tried to bring you round. Then cook telephoned for Dr.
 Lansdowne.’
 
 “‘Are you Dr. Lansdowne?’
 
 “‘He was out. I’m his partner, Dr. Kennedy. How are you feeling?’ I
 asked her.
 
 “‘Better. Stevens, you can go away. Bring me some more tea. Dr. Kennedy
 will have a cup with me.’ She struggled into a sitting position and I
 helped her. Then she told me she had always been subject to these
 attacks, ever since she was a child, that she was to have been a
 pianist, had studied seriously. But the doctors forbade her practising.
 Now she wrote. She admitted that her own emotional scenes overcame her.
 Then we talked of the emotions....”
 
 Dr. Kennedy looked at me as if enquiringly.
 
 “Do you want to hear any more?”
 
 “You saw her often after that?”
 
 “Nearly every day, all the time she was here.”
 
 “And talked about the emotions?”
 
 “Sometimes. What are you implying? What are you trying to get at?
 Whatever it is, you are wrong. I was in her confidence, she liked
 talking to me. I did her good.”
 
 “With drugs or dogma?” I asked.
 
 “With sympathy. She had suffered terribly, more than any woman should be
 allowed to suffer. And she was ultra-sensitive, her nerves were all
 exposed, inflamed. You have sometimes that elusive, strange resemblance
 to her. But she had neither strength nor courage and as for hardness ...
 she did not know the meaning of the word.”
 
 “You are wrong. Last night I heard her talk to Gabriel Stanton.”
 
 “Did you?” His eyes lightened. “Tell me. But he was not the man for her,
 never the man for her. Not sufficiently flexible. He took her too
 seriously.”
 
 “Can a man take a woman too seriously?”
 
 “An emotional, nervous, delicate woman. Yes. You’ve been through all the
 letters?”
 
 “No. There are a few more.”
 
 They were on the table, and I put my hand on them. I was sure that no
 one but I must see them.
 
 “The first two or three times that Gabriel Stanton came down he stayed
 at ‘The King’s Arms.’ She was always ill after he left, always. She made
 a brave effort, poor girl. Day after day I have come in and seen her
 sitting as you are, paper before her, and ink. I don’t think anything
 ever came of it. She would play too, for hours.”
 
 “You stayed away when he was here, I suppose?”
 
 “No! Not always. I was sent for once or twice. She had those heart
 attacks.”
 
 “Hysteria?”
 
 “Heart attacks. He did not know how to treat or calm her.”
 
 “Poor Gabriel Stanton!”
 
 “Poor Margaret Capel!” he retorted. “I wouldn’t try to write the story
 if I were you. You misjudge her, I am sure you do. She was
 delicate-minded.”
 
 “Why did she have him down here at all? She knew the risk she ran. Why
 did she not wait until the decree _was_ made absolute?” For by now, of
 course, I knew how the trouble came about.
 
 “She was in love with him.”
 
 “She did not know the meaning of the word. She was philandering with you
 at the time.” He grew red.
 
 “She was not. I was her doctor.”
 
 “And are not doctors men?”
 
 “Not with their patients.”
 
 I looked at him thoughtfully and remembered Ella. He answered as if he
 read my thoughts.
 
 “You are not my patient, you are Lansdowne’s.” He gave a short uncertain
 laugh when he had said that. That seemed amusing to me, for I did not
 care whether he was a man or not, feeling ill and superlatively old and
 sexless, also that he lacked something, had played this game with
 Margaret, the game she had taught him, until his withers were all
 unwrung, until she had bereft him of reason, leaving him empty, as it
 were hollow, filled up with words, meaningless words that were part of
 the fine game, of which he had forgotten or never known the rules.
 
 After he left I read her next letter, the one written after Gabriel
 Stanton had been to Pineland for the first time, and she had told him
 how she felt about him.
 
                                                     Carbies, Pineland.
 
   I have been writing to you and tearing up the letters ever since you
   left. I look back and cannot believe you were here only two days.
   The two days passed like two hours, but now it seems as if we must
   have been together for weeks. You told me so much and I ... I
   exposed myself to you completely. You know everything about me, it
   is incredible but nevertheless true that I tried all I knew to show
   you the real woman on whom you are basing such high hopes. What are
   you thinking of me now, I wonder. That I am a little mad, not quite
   human? What is this genius that separates me from the world, from
   all my kind? My books, my little plays, my piano-playing! There is a
   little of it in all of them, is there not, my friend, my companion,
   the first person to whom I have ever spoken so frankly. Is it not
   true that I have a wider vision, intenser emotions than other women?
   Love me therefore better, and differently than any man has ever
   loved a woman. You say that you will, you do, that I am to pour
   myself out on you. I like that phrase of yours—you need never use it
   again, you have already used it twice.
 
             “I shall remember while the light is yet,
             And when the darkness comes I shall not forget.”
 
   It went through me, there is nowhere it has not permeated. And see,
   I obey you. I no longer feel a pariah and an outcast, with all the
   world pointing at me. The degradation of my marriage is only a
   nightmare, something, as you say, that never happened. I look out on
   the garden and the sea beyond, on the jagged coast-line and the
   green tree-clad hills, all bathed in sunshine, and forget that I
   have suffered. I am glad to know you so intimately that I can
   picture each hour what you are doing. You are not happy, and I am
   almost glad. What could I give you if you were happy? But as it is
   when you are bored and wearied, with your office work, depressed in
   your uncongenial home, I can send you my thoughts and they will flow
   in upon you like fresh water to a stagnant pool. I have at times so
   great a sense of strength and power. At others, as you know, I am
   faint and fearful. Nobody but you has ever understood that I am not
   inconsistent, only a different woman at different times. I know I
   see things that are hidden from other people, not mystic things, but
   the great Scheme unfolded, the scheme of the world, why some suffer
   and some enjoy, what God means by it all. In my visions it is
   blindingly brilliant and clear, and I understand God as no human
   being has ever understood Him before. I want to be His messenger, to
   show the interblending marvel. I know it is for that I am here. Then
   I write a short story that says nothing at all, or I sit at the
   piano and try to express, all alone by myself, that for which I
   cannot find words. Afterwards I go to bed and know I am a fool, and
   lie awake all night, miserable enough at my futility. I have always
   lived like this save during those frenzied months when I thought
   love was the expression for which I had waited, and with my eyes on
   the stars, blundered into a morass. Notwithstanding we have hardly
   spoken of it, you know the love I ask from you has nothing in common
   with the love ordinary men and women have for each other, nothing at
   all in common. The very thought of physical love makes me sick and
   ill. That is still a nightmare, nothing more nor less. I want my
   thoughts held, not my hands. How intimate we must be for me to write
   you like this, and the weeks we have known each other so few.
 
   You won’t read this in the office, you will take it home with you to
   the bookish and precise flat in Hampstead, and hoard it up until the
   little round-backed sister with her claim and her querulousness has
   left you in peace. She is part of that great scheme of things which
   evades me when I try to write it. Why should you sacrifice your
   freedom to make a home for her? Poor cripple, with her cramped small
   brain; your companion to whom you are tied like a sound man to a
   leper, and with whom you cannot converse and yet must sometimes
   talk. You cannot read or write very well in the atmosphere she
   creates for you, but must listen to gossip and answer fittingly,
   wasting the precious hours. Nevertheless you will find time to
   answer this letter. I shall not watch for the coming of the post and
   be disappointed. She does not care for you overmuch I fear, this
   poor sister of yours, only for herself. I am sorry she is
   hunchbacked and ailing. But I am sorrier still that she is your
   sister and burdens you. Life has given you so little. Your dreary
   orphaned childhood in your uncle’s large hospitable family, of which
   you were always the one apart, you and that same suffering sister;
   your strenuous schooldays. You say you were happy at Oxford, but for
   the cramping certainty that there was no choice of a career; only
   the stool at Stanton’s, and so repayment for all your uncle had done
   for you. My poor Gabriel, it seems to me your boyhood and your
   manhood have been spent. And now you have only me. Me! with hands
   without gifts and arid lips, an absorbing egotism, and only my
   passionate desire for expression. I don’t want to live; I want to
   write, and even for that I am not strong enough! My message is too
   big for me. Hold me and enfold me, I want to rest in you; you are
   unlike all other men because you want to give and give and give,
   asking nothing. And therefore you are my mate, because I am unlike
   all other women, being a genius. You alone of all men or women I
   have ever known will not doubt that I have a message, although I may
   never prove it. You don’t want to be proud of me, only to rest me.
 
   Which reminds me—that book on Staffordshire Pottery will never be
   written. How will you explain it to your partners, and the wasted
   expense of the illustrations? I shall send you a business letter
   withdrawing; then I suppose you will say that you had better run
   down and discuss the matter with me. But, oh! it’s so wonderful to
   know that you, you yourself will know without any explaining that I
   cannot write about pottery just now. I _have_ written a few verses.
   I will send them to you when they are polished and the rhythm is
   perfect. There will be little else left by then!
 
   Write and tell me that one day you will come again to Pineland. One
   day, but not yet. I could not bear it, not to think of you
   concretely here with me again, this week or next. I want you as a
   light in the distance, my eyes are too weak to see you more
   closely.... I won’t even erase that, although it will hurt you.
   Sometimes I feel I am not going to bring you happiness, only drain
   you of sympathy.
 
                                                              MARGARET.
 
                                                 Church Row, Hampstead.
 
   _My dear, dear love, you wonderful, wonderful
      Margaret:_—
 
   I wish I could tell you, I wish I could begin to tell you all you
   mean to me, what our two days together meant to me. You ask me what
   I am thinking of you. If only I could let you know that, you would
   know everything. For your sufferings I love you, for your crucified
   gift and agonies. You say I am to love you better and differently
   than any man has ever loved woman. My angel child, I do. Can’t you
   feel it? Tell me you do. That is all I want, that you tell me you do
   know how I worship you, that it means something to you, helps you a
   little.
 
   What am I to answer to your next sentence? You say you ask of me a
   love that has nothing in common with the love ordinary men and women
   have for each other, that physical love makes you sick and ill.
   Beloved, everything shall be as you wish between us. I would not so
   much as kiss the hem of your dress if you forbade it by a look, nor
   your delicate white hands. I love your hands. You let me hold them,
   you must let me hold them sometimes. Dear generous one, I will never
   trouble you. I am for you to use as you will, that you use me at all
   is gift enough. This time will pass this trying dreadful time. Until
   then, and afterwards if you wish it, I will be only your
   comrade—your very faithful knight. I love your delicacy and reserve,
   all you withhold from me. I yearn to be your lover, your husband;
   all and everything to you. Don’t hate and despise me. You say when
   radiant love came to you, your eyes were on the stars, and you
   blundered into a morass. But, sweetheart, darling, if I had been
   your lover—husband, do you think this would have happened? Think,
   _think_. I cannot bear that you should confuse any love with mine. I
   want to hold you in my arms, teach you. I can’t write any more, not
   now. Thank you for your letter, for my sleepless nights, for my
   dreams, for everything. You are my whole world.
 
                                                               GABRIEL.
 
                                                           Greyfriars’.
 
   I fear I wrote you a stupid letter last night. I had had a long
   evening with my sister. She insisted on reading to me from a
   wonderful book she has just bought. It was on some new craze with
   the high-sounding name of Christian Science. The book was called
   “Science and Health.” More utter piffle and balderdash I have never
   heard. There were whole sentences without meaning, and many calling
   themselves sentences were without verbs. I swallowed yawn after
   yawn. Then she left off reading and asked my opinion. I suggested
   the stuff might have emanated from Earlswood. She made me a dreadful
   scene. It seemed she had already consulted a prophetess of this new
   religion and had been promised she should be made whole if only she
   had sufficient faith! Now I was trying to “shake her faith and so
   retard her cure”; she sobbed. Poor woman! I tried reasoning with
   her, went over a few passages and asked her to note inconsistency
   after inconsistency, stupidity after stupidity, blasphemy and
   irrelevance. She cried more. Then my own unkindness struck me. She
   too had had a vision, seen the marvellous sun rise. To be made
   whole! She who had been thirty years a cripple and in pain always. I
   tried to withdraw all I had said, to find a strange and mystic sense
   and meaning in the stuff. I think I comforted her a little. I
   insisted she should go on with her induction, or initiation, or
   whatever they call it. There are paid healers; the prophets play the
   game for cash. I gave her money. I could not bear her thanks or to
   remember I had been unkind, I, with my own overwhelming happiness.
   If I were able I would make happiness for all the world. When at
   last I was alone I sat a long time with your letter in my hand, your
   dear, dear letter. I don’t know what I wrote; dare not recall my
   words. Forgive me, whatever it was. If there was a word in my letter
   that should not have been there forgive me. Bear with me, dear. You
   don’t know what you are to me, I am bewildered with the mystery.
 
   About the book on Staffordshire Pottery. Don’t give it another
   thought. I can arrange everything here without any trouble. You need
   not write. But if you do, and suggest, as you say, that I shall come
   down and discuss the matter with you, why then, then—will you write?
   I want to come. I promise not to cut myself shaving this time.
   Although is it not natural my hand should have been unsteady? It
   shakes now. I must come and discuss the pottery book or anything.
   _Let me._ It is much to ask, but I won’t be in your way. I’ve some
   manuscripts to go through. I’ll never leave the hotel. But I want to
   be in the same place.
 
                                                  For ever and ever,
                                                          YOUR GABRIEL.
 
 
 
 
                               CHAPTER VII
 
 
 Of course she let him come. Not only that week-end but many others,
 until the early spring deepened into the late, the yellow gorse grew
 more golden, and the birds sang as they mated. It was the same time of
 year with me now, and I saw Margaret Capel and Gabriel Stanton often
 together in the house or garden, lying on the stones by the sea, walking
 toward the hills. My strength was always ebbing and I was glad to be
 alone, drowsily listening to or dreaming of the lovers, drugging myself
 with codein, seeing visions. I fancy Benham began to suspect me, counted
 the little silver pills that held my ease and entertainment. I
 circumvented her easily. Copied the prescription and sent it to my
 secretary in London to be made up, replaced each extra one I took. I was
 not getting better, although I wrote Ella in every letter of returning
 strength, and told her that I was again at work. My conscience had
 loosened a little, and I almost believed it to be true. Anyway I had the
 letters, and knew that when the time came it would be easy to transcribe
 them. Meanwhile I told myself disingenuously that I hoped to become
 better acquainted with my hero and heroine. I was wooing their
 confidence, learning their hearts. Now Gabriel’s was clear, but
 Margaret’s less distinct. I saw them sometimes as in a magic-lantern
 show, when the house was quiet, and I in the darkness of my bedroom. On
 the circle in the white sheet that hung then against the wall, I saw
 them walk and talk, he pleading, she coquetting. Whilst the slide was
 being changed Peter Kennedy acted as spokesman:
 
 “Week-end after week-end Gabriel Stanton came down, and all the hours of
 the day they passed together. Four months of the waiting time had gone
 by and her freedom was in sight. Her nerves were taut and fretted. She
 often had fainting attacks. He never questioned me about her but once. I
 told him the truth, that she had suffered, was suffering more than any
 woman can endure, any young and delicate woman. And her love for him
 grew....”
 
 I did not want to stop the show, the moving figures and changing slides,
 yet I called out from my swaying bed:
 
 “No, no, she never loved him.” And Peter Kennedy turned his eyes upon
 me, his surprised and questioning eyes.
 
 “Why do you say that? Do you know a better way of loving?”
 
 “Yes, many better ways.”
 
 “You have loved, then?”
 
 “Read my books.”
 
 “The love-making in your novels? Is that all you know?” A coal fell from
 the fire; I frowned and said something sharply. He did not go on, and I
 may have slept a little. When I looked up again there was no more sheet
 nor Peter. Instead Margaret herself sat in the easy-chair and asked me
 how I was getting on with her story.
 
 “Not very well. I don’t understand why you took pleasure in making
 Gabriel miserable by your scenes and vapours. That first day now. What
 did you mean by telling him of your reaction on seeing him, that it
 might have been because he had cut himself shaving, or because of the
 shape of his hat; the hang of his coat disappointed you. Either you
 loved the man or you did not. Why hurt his feelings, deliberately,
 unnecessarily? Why did you tell him not to come and then telegraph him?
 Why should I write your story? I don’t know the end of it, but already I
 am out of sympathy with you.”
 
 “You were that from the first,” she answered unhappily. “Don’t think I
 am ignorant of that. In a way, I suppose you are still jealous of me.”
 
 “I! jealous! And of you?”
 
 “Why did you pretend you did not know my books, and send for them to the
 London Library? You knew them well enough and resented my reputation.
 The _Spectator_, the _Saturday Review_, the _Quarterly_; you were
 dismissed in a paragraph where I had a column and a turn.”
 
 “At least you never sold as well as I did.”
 
 “That is where the trouble comes in, as you would say—although you are a
 little better in that way than you used to be. You wanted to ‘serve God
 and Mammon,’ to be applauded in the literary reviews whilst working up
 sentimental situations with which to draw tears from shopgirls....”
 
 “I am conscious of being unfairly treated by the so-called literary
 papers,” I argued. “I write of human beings, men and women; loving,
 suffering, living. You wrote of abstractions, making phrases. The
 sentences of one of your characters could have been put in the mouths of
 any of the others. Life, it was of life I wrote. Now that I am
 dying....”
 
 “You are not dying, only drugged. And you are jealous again all the
",Twilight
21," guard against.”
 
 “Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost.
 Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”
 
 “I have seen the police.”
 
 “Ah!”
 
 “But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the
 inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical
 jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as
 the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”
 
 Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he
 cried.
 
 “They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the
 house with me.”
 
 “Has he come with you to-night?”
 
 “No. His orders were to stay in the house.”
 
 Again Holmes raved in the air.
 
 “Why did you come to me?” he said; “and, above all, why did you not
 come at once?”
 
 “I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast
 about my troubles, and was advised by him to come to you.”
 
 “It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted
 before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which
 you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”
 
 “There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
 pocket, and drawing out a piece of discolored, blue-tinted paper, he
 laid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that
 on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,
 unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular
 color. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am
 inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,
 fluttered out from among the others, and in that way have escaped
 destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us
 much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The
 writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”
 
 Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which
 showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It
 was headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical
 notices:
 
 “4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
 
 “7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St.
 Augustine.
 
 “9th. McCauley cleared.
 
 “10th. John Swain cleared.
 
 “12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”
 
 “Thank you!” said Holmes, folding up the paper, and returning it to
 our visitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We
 cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get
 home instantly and act.”
 
 “What shall I do?”
 
 “There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put
 this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which
 you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the
 other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only
 one which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry
 conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box
 out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?”
 
 “Entirely.”
 
 “Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think
 that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to
 weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to
 remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear
 up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.”
 
 “I thank you,” said the young man, rising, and pulling on his overcoat.
 “You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you
 advise.”
 
 “Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the
 meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are
 threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”
 
 “By train from Waterloo.”
 
 “It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you
 may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”
 
 “I am armed.”
 
 “That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”
 
 “I shall see you at Horsham, then?”
 
 “No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”
 
 “Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to
 the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.”
 He shook hands with us, and took his leave. Outside the wind still
 screamed, and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows.
 This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad
 elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now
 to have been reabsorbed by them once more.
 
 Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
 forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit
 his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings
 as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
 
 “I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have
 had none more fantastic than this.”
 
 “Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”
 
 “Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to
 me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”
 
 “But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what
 these perils are?”
 
 “There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.
 
 “Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this
 unhappy family?”
 
 Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms
 of his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he
 remarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all
 its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which
 led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As
 Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of
 a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link
 in a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the
 other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results
 which the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the
 study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
 aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch,
 it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the
 facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies,
 as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even
 in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare
 accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should
 possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,
 and this I have endeavored in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you
 on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits
 in a very precise fashion.”
 
 “Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy,
 astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany
 variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region
 within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,
 sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,
 swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I
 think, were the main points of my analysis.”
 
 Holmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said
 then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all
 the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away
 in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants
 it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us
 to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand
 me down the letter K of the American Encyclopædia which stands upon
 the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation,
 and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start
 with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong
 reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all
 their habits, and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida
 for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of
 solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of some one
 or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear
 of some one or something which drove him from America. As to what it
 was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable
 letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you
 remark the post-marks of those letters?”
 
 “The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third
 from London.”
 
 “From East London. What do you deduce from that?”
 
 “They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”
 
 “Excellent. We have already a clew. There can be no doubt that the
 probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board
 of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of
 Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,
 in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest
 anything?”
 
 “A greater distance to travel.”
 
 “But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”
 
 “Then I do not see the point.”
 
 “There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
 or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always sent their
 singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.
 You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from
 Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would
 have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But as a matter of fact
 seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the
 difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter, and the
 sailing-vessel which brought the writer.”
 
 “It is possible.”
 
 “More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of
 this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has
 always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to
 travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we
 cannot count upon delay.”
 
 “Good God!” I cried; “what can it mean, this relentless persecution?”
 
 “The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance
 to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite
 clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not
 have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s
 jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men
 of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the
 holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be
 the initials of an individual, and becomes the badge of a society.”
 
 “But of what society?”
 
 “Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking
 his voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”
 
 “I never have.”
 
 Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it
 is,” said he, presently, “‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the
 fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This
 terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in
 the Southern States after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local
 branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,
 Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used
 for political purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro
 voters, and the murdering and driving from the country of those who
 were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by
 a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally
 recognized shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or
 orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly
 abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the
 matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some
 strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organization of the
 society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case
 upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in
 which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For
 some years the organization flourished, in spite of the efforts of the
 United States Government and of the better classes of the community in
 the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly
 collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort
 since that date.’
 
 “You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the
 sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance
 of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause
 and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the
 more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this
 register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,
 and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is
 recovered.”
 
 “Then the page we have seen—”
 
 “Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the
 pips to A, B, and C,’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them.
 Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the
 country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister
 result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into
 this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has
 in the mean time is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more
 to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin, and let
 us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still
 more miserable ways of our fellow-men.”
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued
 brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
 Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.
 
 “You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I have, I
 foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young
 Openshaw’s.”
 
 “What steps will you take?” I asked.
 
 “It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may
 have to go down to Horsham, after all.”
 
 “You will not go there first?”
 
 “No, I shall commence with the city. Just ring the bell, and the maid
 will bring up your coffee.”
 
 As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced
 my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.
 
 “Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”
 
 “Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How was it
 done?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
 
 “My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading, ‘Tragedy near
 Waterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account: ‘Between nine and ten last
 night Police-constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo
 Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night,
 however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help
 of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.
 The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police,
 the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young
 gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in
 his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It
 is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last
 train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme
 darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the
 small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces
 of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been
 the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect
 of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the
 river-side landing-stages.’”
 
 We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken
 than I had ever seen him.
 
 “That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said, at last. “It is a petty
 feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter
 with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this
 gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him
 away to his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room
 in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks, and a
 nervous clasping and unclasping of his long, thin hands.
 
 “They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed, at last. “How could they
 have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line
 to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a
 night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in
 the long run. I am going out now!”
 
 [Illustration: “‘HOLMES,’ I CRIED, ‘YOU ARE TOO LATE’”]
 
 “To the police?”
 
 “No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take
 the flies, but not before.”
 
 All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the
 evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come
 back yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale
 and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and, tearing a piece from the
 loaf, he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught
 of water.
 
 “You are hungry,” I remarked.
 
 “Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
 breakfast.”
 
 “Nothing?”
 
 “Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”
 
 “And how have you succeeded?”
 
 “Well.”
 
 “You have a clew?”
 
 “I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long
 remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark
 upon them. It is well thought of!”
 
 “What do you mean?”
 
 He took an orange from the cupboard, and, tearing it to pieces, he
 squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five, and thrust
 them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J.
 O.” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Bark
 _Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.”
 
 “That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may
 give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his
 fate as Openshaw did before him.”
 
 “And who is this Captain Calhoun?”
 
 “The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”
 
 “How did you trace it, then?”
 
 He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates
 and names.
 
 “I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and the
 files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel
 which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There
 were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during
 those months. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my
 attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from
 London, the name is that which is given to one of the States of the
 Union.”
 
 “Texas, I think.”
 
 “I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an
 American origin.”
 
 “What then?”
 
 “I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the bark _Lone
 Star_ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I
 then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of
 London.”
 
 “Yes?”
 
 “The _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert
 Dock, and found that she had been taken down the river by the early
 tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend,
 and learned that she had passed some time ago; and as the wind is
 easterly, I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins, and not
 very far from the Isle of Wight.”
 
 “What will you do, then?”
 
 “Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are, as I learn,
 the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and
 Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last
 night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By
 the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will
 have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police
 of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a
 charge of murder.”
 
 There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and
 the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips
 which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as
 themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the
 equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone
 Star_ of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that
 somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was
 seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved
 upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the
 _Lone Star_.
 
 
 
 
 Adventure VI
 
 THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
 
 
 Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the
 Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The
 habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he
 was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams
 and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt
 to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that
 the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years
 he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror
 and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,
 pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a
 chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
 
 One night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the
 hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up
 in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made
 a little face of disappointment.
 
 “A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”
 
 I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
 
 We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps
 upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some
 dark-colored stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
 
 “You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly
 losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my
 wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!”
 she cried; “I do so want a little help.”
 
 “Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you
 startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”
 
 “I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always
 the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a
 light-house.
 
 “It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and
 water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you
 rather that I sent James off to bed?”
 
 “Oh, no, no! I want the Doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa.
 He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!”
 
 It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s
 trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school
 companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.
 Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring
 him back to her?
 
 It seemed that it was. She had the surest information that of late he
 had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest
 east of the city. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one
 day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening.
 But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay
 there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison
 or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of
 it, at the “Bar of Gold,” in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to
 do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a
 place, and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded
 him?
 
 There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.
 Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,
 why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and
 as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were
 alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a
 cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had
 given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my arm-chair and cheery
 sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a
 strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only
 could show how strange it was to be.
 
 But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
 Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
 which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.
 Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of
 steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the
 den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down
 the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken
 feet, and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found
 the latch, and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy
 with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
 forecastle of an emigrant ship.
 
 Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in
 strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back
 and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye
 turned upon the new-comer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered
 little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning
 poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay
 silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in
 a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes,
 and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own
 thoughts, and paying little heed to the words of his neighbor. At the
 farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a
 three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw
 resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into
 the fire.
 
 As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for
 me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
 
 “Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of
 mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”
 
 There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and, peering
 through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring
 out at me.
 
 “My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,
 with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”
 
 “Nearly eleven.”
 
 “Of what day?”
 
 “Of Friday, June 19th.”
 
 “Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you
 want to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms, and began
 to sob in a high treble key.
 
 “I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two
 days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”
 
 “So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few
 hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home
 with you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your
 hand! Have you a cab?”
 
 “Yes, I have one waiting.”
 
 “Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,
 Watson. I am all off color. I can do nothing for myself.”
 
 I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,
 holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,
 and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat
 by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice
 whispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell
 quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come
 from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,
 very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down
 from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude
 from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took
 all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
 astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but
 I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
 regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire, and grinning at
 my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight
 motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half
 round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped
 senility.
 
 “Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”
 
 “As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would
 have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I
 should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”
 
 “I have a cab outside.”
 
",Holmes
22," pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. The
 more he thought of the Jew’s admonition, the more he was at a loss to
 divine its real purpose and meaning.
 
 He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes,
 which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin;
 and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been
 selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker,
 until another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged. He
 was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where
 he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely. He remained
 lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed
 the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him,
 began to read.
 
 He turned over the leaves. Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a
 passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the
 volume. It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals;
 and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of
 dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that
 had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye
 of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as
 they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so
 maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had
 confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.
 Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night,
 had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts,
 to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs
 quail, to think of. The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid,
 that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon
 them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow
 murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.
 
 In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him.
 Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such
 deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved
 for crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm,
 and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from
 his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a
 poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it
 might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in
 the midst of wickedness and guilt.
 
 He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in
 his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.
 
 “What’s that!” he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure
 standing by the door. “Who’s there?”
 
 “Me. Only me,” replied a tremulous voice.
 
 Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door.
 It was Nancy.
 
 “Put down the light,” said the girl, turning away her head. “It hurts
 my eyes.”
 
 Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill.
 The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and
 wrung her hands; but made no reply.
 
 “God forgive me!” she cried after a while, “I never thought of this.”
 
 “Has anything happened?” asked Oliver. “Can I help you? I will if I
 can. I will, indeed.”
 
 She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a
 gurgling sound, gasped for breath.
 
 “Nancy!” cried Oliver, “What is it?”
 
 The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground;
 and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered
 with cold.
 
 Oliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there,
 for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head,
 and looked round.
 
 “I don’t know what comes over me sometimes,” said she, affecting to
 busy herself in arranging her dress; “it’s this damp dirty room, I
 think. Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?”
 
 “Am I to go with you?” asked Oliver.
 
 “Yes. I have come from Bill,” replied the girl. “You are to go with
 me.”
 
 “What for?” asked Oliver, recoiling.
 
 “What for?” echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again,
 the moment they encountered the boy’s face. “Oh! For no harm.”
 
 “I don’t believe it,” said Oliver: who had watched her closely.
 
 “Have it your own way,” rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. “For no
 good, then.”
 
 Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl’s better
 feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion
 for his helpless state. But, then, the thought darted across his mind
 that it was barely eleven o’clock; and that many people were still in
 the streets: of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his
 tale. As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward: and said,
 somewhat hastily, that he was ready.
 
 Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his
 companion. She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a
 look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what
 had been passing in his thoughts.
 
 “Hush!” said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as
 she looked cautiously round. “You can’t help yourself. I have tried
 hard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If
 ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.”
 
 Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with
 great surprise. She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was
 white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.
 
 “I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do
 now,” continued the girl aloud; “for those who would have fetched you,
 if I had not, would have been far more rough than me. I have promised
 for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm
 to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death. See here! I have borne
 all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.”
 
 She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and
 continued, with great rapidity:
 
 “Remember this! And don’t let me suffer more for you, just now. If I
 could help you, I would; but I have not the power. They don’t mean to
 harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! Every
 word from you is a blow for me. Give me your hand. Make haste! Your
 hand!”
 
 She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and,
 blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was
 opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as
 quickly closed, when they had passed out. A hackney-cabriolet was in
 waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing
 Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close.
 The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed,
 without the delay of an instant.
 
 The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into
 his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted. All was
 so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he
 was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to
 which the Jew’s steps had been directed on the previous evening.
 
 For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty
 street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl’s voice was
 in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that
 he had not the heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the opportunity
 was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was shut.
 
 “This way,” said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time.
 “Bill!”
 
 “Hallo!” replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a
 candle. “Oh! That’s the time of day. Come on!”
 
 This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty
 welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes’ temperament. Nancy, appearing much
 gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.
 
 “Bull’s-eye’s gone home with Tom,” observed Sikes, as he lighted them
 up. “He’d have been in the way.”
 
 “That’s right,” rejoined Nancy.
 
 “So you’ve got the kid,” said Sikes when they had all reached the room:
 closing the door as he spoke.
 
 “Yes, here he is,” replied Nancy.
 
 “Did he come quiet?” inquired Sikes.
 
 “Like a lamb,” rejoined Nancy.
 
 “I’m glad to hear it,” said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; “for the
 sake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it.
 Come here, young ’un; and let me read you a lectur’, which is as well
 got over at once.”
 
 Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver’s cap and
 threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat
 himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.
 
 “Now, first: do you know wot this is?” inquired Sikes, taking up a
 pocket-pistol which lay on the table.
 
 Oliver replied in the affirmative.
 
 “Well, then, look here,” continued Sikes. “This is powder; that ’ere’s
 a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin’.”
 
 Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to;
 and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and
 deliberation.
 
 “Now it’s loaded,” said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.
 
 “Yes, I see it is, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “Well,” said the robber, grasping Oliver’s wrist, and putting the
 barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the
 boy could not repress a start; “if you speak a word when you’re out
 o’doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in
 your head without notice. So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak
 without leave, say your prayers first.”
 
 Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase
 its effect, Mr. Sikes continued.
 
 “As near as I know, there isn’t anybody as would be asking very
 partickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn’t take this
 devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn’t for
 your own good. D’ye hear me?”
 
 “The short and the long of what you mean,” said Nancy: speaking very
 emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his
 serious attention to her words: “is, that if you’re crossed by him in
 this job you have on hand, you’ll prevent his ever telling tales
 afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance
 of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way
 of business, every month of your life.”
 
 “That’s it!” observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; “women can always put
 things in fewest words.—Except when it’s blowing up; and then they
 lengthens it out. And now that he’s thoroughly up to it, let’s have
 some supper, and get a snooze before starting.”
 
 In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth;
 disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of
 porter and a dish of sheep’s heads: which gave occasion to several
 pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular
 coincidence of “jemmies” being a can name, common to them, and also to
 an ingenious implement much used in his profession. Indeed, the worthy
 gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on
 active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof,
 it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a
 draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than
 four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.
 
 Supper being ended—it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great
 appetite for it—Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits
 and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many
 imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely. Oliver
 stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on
 a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before
 it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.
 
 For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy
 might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the
 girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to
 trim the light. Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell
 asleep.
 
 When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was
 thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which
 hung over the back of a chair. Nancy was busily engaged in preparing
 breakfast. It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning,
 and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against
 the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.
 
 “Now, then!” growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; “half-past five! Look
 sharp, or you’ll get no breakfast; for it’s late as it is.”
 
 Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast,
 he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite
 ready.
 
 Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie
 round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his
 shoulders. Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely
 pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same
 pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his,
 and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.
 
 Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope
 of meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in
 front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXI.
 THE EXPEDITION
 
 
 It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and
 raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night had
 been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the
 kennels were overflowing. There was a faint glimmering of the coming
 day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the
 scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street
 lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the
 wet house-tops, and dreary streets. There appeared to be nobody
 stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were
 all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were
 noiseless and empty.
 
 By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had
 fairly begun to break. Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a
 few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and
 then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver
 bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner
 who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his
 arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time. The
 public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open. By
 degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people
 were met with. Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their
 work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads;
 donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock
 or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken
 concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern
 suburbs of the town. As they approached the City, the noise and traffic
 gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch
 and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle. It was
 as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy
 morning of half the London population had begun.
 
 Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square,
 Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into
 Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a
 tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.
 
 It was market-morning. The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with
 filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking
 bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest
 upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above. All the pens in the centre
 of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into
 the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the
 gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.
 Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and
 vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the
 whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of
 the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs,
 the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides;
 the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every
 public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and
 yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every
 corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty
 figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the
 throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite
 confounded the senses.
 
 Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the
 thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the
 numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy. He nodded,
 twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many
 invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they
 were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane
 into Holborn.
 
 “Now, young ’un!” said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew’s
 Church, “hard upon seven! you must step out. Come, don’t lag behind
 already, Lazy-legs!”
 
 Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion’s
 wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast
 walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as
 well as he could.
 
 They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park
 corner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his
 pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind,
 came up. Seeing “Hounslow” written on it, he asked the driver with as
 much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far
 as Isleworth.
 
 “Jump up,” said the man. “Is that your boy?”
 
 “Yes; he’s my boy,” replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting
 his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.
 
 “Your father walks rather too quick for you, don’t he, my man?”
 inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.
 
 “Not a bit of it,” replied Sikes, interposing. “He’s used to it. Here,
 take hold of my hand, Ned. In with you!”
 
 Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver,
 pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest
 himself.
 
 As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and
 more, where his companion meant to take him. Kensington, Hammersmith,
 Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on
 as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey. At length,
 they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way
 beyond which, another road appeared to run off. And here, the cart
 stopped.
 
 Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand
 all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look
 upon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant
 manner.
 
 “Good-bye, boy,” said the man.
 
 “He’s sulky,” replied Sikes, giving him a shake; “he’s sulky. A young
 dog! Don’t mind him.”
 
 “Not I!” rejoined the other, getting into his cart. “It’s a fine day,
 after all.” And he drove away.
 
 Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he
 might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his
 journey.
 
 They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and
 then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many
 large gardens and gentlemen’s houses on both sides of the way, and
 stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town. Here
 against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large
 letters, “Hampton.” They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours.
 At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old
 public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the
 kitchen fire.
 
 The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the
 middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the
 fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking
 and smoking. They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes;
 and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade
 sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their
 company.
 
 They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr.
 Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to
 feel quite certain they were not going any further. Being much tired
 with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first;
 then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell
 asleep.
 
 It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing
 himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy
 in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint
 of ale.
 
 “So, you’re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?” inquired Sikes.
 
 “Yes, I am,” replied the man, who seemed a little the worse—or better,
 as the case might be—for drinking; “and not slow about it neither. My
 horse hasn’t got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in
 the mornin’; and he won’t be long a-doing of it. Here’s luck to him.
 Ecod! he’s a good ’un!”
 
 “Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?” demanded Sikes,
 pushing the ale towards his new friend.
 
 “If you’re going directly, I can,” replied the man, looking out of the
 pot. “Are you going to Halliford?”
 
 “Going on to Shepperton,” replied Sikes.
 
 “I’m your man, as far as I go,” replied the other. “Is all paid,
 Becky?”
 
 “Yes, the other gentleman’s paid,” replied the girl.
 
 “I say!” said the man, with tipsy gravity; “that won’t do, you know.”
 
 “Why not?” rejoined Sikes. “You’re a-going to accommodate us, and wot’s
 to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?”
 
 The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face;
 having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real
 good fellow. To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had
 been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.
 
 After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company
 good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as
 they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see
 the party start.
 
 The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing
 outside: ready harnessed to the cart. Oliver and Sikes got in without
 any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered
 for a minute or two “to bear him up,” and to defy the hostler and the
 world to produce his equal, mounted also. Then, the hostler was told to
 give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very
 unpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and
 running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those
 feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs, he
 started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right
 gallantly.
 
 The night was very dark. A damp mist rose from the river, and the
 marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was
 piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken;
 for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him
 into conversation. Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the
 cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange
 objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as
 if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.
 
 As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. There was a
 light in the ferry-house window opposite: which streamed across the
 road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves
 beneath it. There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and
 the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind. It seemed
 like quiet music for the repose of the dead.
 
 Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.
 Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took
 Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.
 
 They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected;
 but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes
 and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights
 of a town at no great distance. On looking intently forward, Oliver saw
 that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the
 foot of a bridge.
 
 Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then
 turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.
 
 “The water!” thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. “He has brought me
 to this lonely place to murder me!”
 
 He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for
 his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house:
 all ruinous and decayed. There was a window on each side of the
 dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible.
 The house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited.
 
 Sikes, with Oliver’s hand still in his, softly approached the low
 porch, and raised the latch. The door yielded to the pressure, and they
 passed in together.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXII.
 THE BURGLARY
 
 
 “Hallo!” cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the
 passage.
 
 “Don’t make such a row,” said Sikes, bolting the door. “Show a glim,
 Toby.”
 
 “Aha! my pal!” cried the same voice. “A glim, Barney, a glim! Show the
 gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.”
 
 The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the
 person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a
 wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct
 muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.
 
 “Do you hear?” cried the same voice. “There’s Bill Sikes in the passage
 with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you
 took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you any
 fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you
 thoroughly?”
 
 A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the
 room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on
 the right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same
 individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the
 infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at
 the public-house on Saffron Hill.
 
 “Bister Sikes!” exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; “cub
 id, sir; cub id.”
 
 “Here! you get on first,” said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him.
 “Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.”
 
 Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him;
 and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken
 chairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much
 higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long
 clay pipe. He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with
 large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring,
 shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches. Mr. Crackit (for he it was)
 had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but
 what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew
 curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers,
 ornamented with large common rings. He was a trifle above the middle
 size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by
 no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he
 contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.
 
 “Bill, my boy!” said this figure, turning his head towards the door,
 “I’m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you’d given it up: in which
 case I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!”
 
 Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes
 rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting
 posture, and demanded who that was.
 
 “The boy. Only the boy!” replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the
 fire.
 
 “Wud of Bister Fagid’s lads,” exclaimed Barney, with a grin.
 
 “Fagin’s, eh!” exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. “Wot an inwalable boy
 that’ll make, for the old ladies’ pockets in chapels! His mug is a
 fortin’ to him.”
 
 “There—there’s enough of that,” interposed Sikes, impatiently; and
 stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his
 ear: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a
 long stare of astonishment.
 
 “Now,” said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, “if you’ll give us something
 to eat and drink while we’re waiting, you’ll put some heart in us; or
 in me, at all events. Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself;
 for you’ll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far
 off.”
 
 Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool
 to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing
 where he was, or what was passing around him.
 
 “Here,” said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and
 a bottle upon the table, “Success to the crack!” He rose to honour the
 toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced
 to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents.
 Mr. Sikes did the same.
 
 “A drain for the boy,” said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. “Down with
 it, innocence.”
 
 “Indeed,” said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man’s face;
 “indeed, I—”
 
 “Down with it!” echoed Toby. “Do you think I don’t know what’s good for
 you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.”
 
 “He had better!” said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. “Burn my
 body, if he isn’t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. Drink
 it, you perwerse imp; drink it!”
 
 Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily
 swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a
 violent fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and
 even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.
 
 This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat
 nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the
 two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap. Oliver retained
 his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself
 on the floor: close outside the fender.
 
 They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but
 Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell
 into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes,
 or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other
 of the scenes of the past day: when he was roused by Toby Crackit
 jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.
 
 In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively
 engaged in busy preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped their
 necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats;
 Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he
 hastily crammed into the pockets.
 
 “Barkers for me, Barney,” said Toby Crackit.
 
 “Here they are,” replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. “You
 loaded them yourself.”
 
 “All right!” replied Toby, stowing them away. “The persuaders?”
 
 “I’ve got ’em,” replied Sikes.
 
 “Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies—nothing forgotten?” inquired Toby:
 fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.
 
 “All right,” rejoined his companion. “Bring them bits of timber,
 Barney. That’s the time of day.”
 
 With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney’s hands, who,
 having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on
 Oliver’s cape.
 
 “Now then!” said Sikes, holding out his hand.
 
 Oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the
 air, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand
 mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.
 
 “Take his other hand, Toby,” said Sikes. “Look out, Barney.”
 
 The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet.
 The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having
 made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.
 
 It was now intensely dark. The fog was much heavier than it had been in
 the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that,
 although no rain fell, Oliver’s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes
 after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture
 that was floating about. They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards
 the lights which he had seen before. They were at no great distance
 off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.
 
 “Slap through the town,” whispered Sikes; “there’ll be nobody in the
 way, to-night, to see us.”
 
 Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little
 town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at
 intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs
 occasionally broke the silence of the night. But there was nobody
 abroad. They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two.
 
 Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After
 walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house
 surrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely
 pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.
 
 “The boy next,” said Toby. “Hoist him up; I’ll catch hold of him.”
 
 Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the
 arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass
 on the other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously
 towards the house.
 
 And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and
 terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the
 objects of the expedition. He clasped his hands together, and
 involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. A mist came
 before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs
 failed him; and he sank upon his knees.
 
 “Get up!” murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol
 from his pocket; “Get up, or I’ll strew your brains upon the grass.”
 
 “Oh! for God’s sake let me go!” cried Oliver; “let me run away and die
 in the fields. I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray
 have mercy on me, and do not make me steal. For the love of all the
 bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!”
 
 The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had
 cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his
 hand upon the boy’s mouth, and dragged him to the house.
 
 “Hush!” cried the man; “it won’t answer here. Say another word, and
 I’ll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no
 noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench
 the shutter open. He’s game enough now, I’ll engage. I’ve seen older
 hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold
 night.”
 
 Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin’s head for sending
 Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little
 noise. After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to
 which he had referred, swung open on its hinges.
 
 It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the
 ground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or
 small brewing-place, at the end of the passage. The aperture was so
 small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to
 defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of
 Oliver’s size, nevertheless. A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike’s art,
 sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood
 wide open also.
 
 “Now listen, you young limb,” whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern
 from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver’s face; “I’m a
 going to put you through there. Take this light; go softly up the steps
 straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door;
 unfasten it, and let us in.”
 
 “There’s a bolt at the top, you won’t be able to reach,” interposed
 Toby. “Stand upon one of the hall chairs. There are three there, Bill,
 with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on ’em: which is the
 old lady’s arms.”
 
 “Keep quiet, can’t you?” replied Sikes, with a threatening look. “The
 room-door is open, is it?”
 
 “Wide,” replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. “The game of
 that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog,
 who’s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels
 wakeful. Ha! ha! Barney ’ticed him away to-night. So neat!”
 
 Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed
 without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get
 to work. Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it
 on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against
 the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to
 make a step of his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting
 upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first;
 and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the
 floor inside.
 
 “Take this lantern,” said Sikes, looking into the room. “You see the
 stairs afore you?”
 
 Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, “Yes.” Sikes, pointing to the
 street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice
 that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would
 fall dead that instant.
 
 “It’s done in a minute,” said Sikes, in the same low whisper. “Directly
 I leave go of you, do your work. Hark!”
 
 “What’s that?” whispered the other man.
 
 They listened intently.
 
 “Nothing,” said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver. “Now!”
 
 In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly
 resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one
 effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. Filled
 with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.
 
 “Come back!” suddenly cried Sikes aloud. “Back! back!”
 
 Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and
 by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew
 not whether to advance or fly.
 
 The cry was repeated—a light appeared—a vision of two terrified
 half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes—a
 flash—a loud noise—a smoke—a crash somewhere, but where he knew
 not,—and he staggered back.
 
 Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him
 by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own
 pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy
 up.
 
 “Clasp your arm tighter,” said Sikes, as he drew him through the
 window. “Give me a shawl here. They’ve hit him. Quick! How the boy
 bleeds!”
 
 Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of
 fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried
 over uneven ground at a rapid pace. And then, the noises grew confused
 in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy’s heart;
 and he saw or heard no more.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXIII.
 WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR.
 BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON
 SOME POINTS
 
 
 The night was bitter cold. The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a
 hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways
 and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which,
 as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it
 savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies,
 scattered it in air. Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for
 the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God
 they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him
 down and die. Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare
 streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may,
 can hardly open them in a more bitter world.
 
 Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the
 matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already
 introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a
 cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree
 of complacency, at a small round table: on which stood a tray of
 corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most
 grateful meal that matrons enjoy. In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to
 solace herself with a cup of tea. As she glanced from the table to the
 fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a
 small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently
 increased,—so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.
 
 “Well!” said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking
 reflectively at the fire; “I’m sure we have all on us a great deal to
 be grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!”
 
 Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental
 blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver
 spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin
 tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.
 
 How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! The
 black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs.
 Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney’s
 hand.
 
 “Drat the pot!” said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on
 the hob; “a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups! What
 use is it of, to anybody! Except,” said Mrs. Corney, pausing, “except
 to a poor desolate creature like me. Oh dear!”
 
 With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more
 resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate. The small
 teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections
 of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years);
 and she was overpowered.
 
 “I shall never get another!” said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; “I shall
 never get another—like him.”
 
 Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is
 uncertain. It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it
 as she spoke; and took it up afterwards. She had just tasted her first
 cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.
 
 “Oh, come in with you!” said Mrs. Corney, sharply. “Some of the old
 women dying, I suppose. They always die when I’m at meals. Don’t stand
 there, letting the cold air in, don’t. What’s amiss now, eh?”
 
 “Nothing, ma’am, nothing,” replied a man’s voice.
 
 “Dear me!” exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, “is that Mr.
 Bumble?”
 
 “At your service, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping
 outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and
 who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a
 bundle in the other. “Shall I shut the door, ma’am?”
 
 The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any
 impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.
 Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold
 himself, shut it without permission.
 
 “Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,” said the matron.
 
 “Hard, indeed, ma’am,” replied the beadle. “Anti-porochial weather
 this, ma’am. We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a
 matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very
 blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.”
 
 “Of course not. When would they be, Mr. Bumble?” said the matron,
 sipping her tea.
 
 “When, indeed, ma’am!” rejoined Mr. Bumble. “Why here’s one man that,
 in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and
 a good pound of cheese, full weight. Is he grateful, ma’am? Is he
 grateful? Not a copper farthing’s worth of it! What does he do, ma’am,
 but ask for a few coals; if it’s only a pocket handkerchief full, he
 says! Coals! What would he do with coals? Toast his cheese with ’em and
 then come back for more. That’s the way with these people, ma’am; give
 ’em a apron full of coals to-day, and they’ll come back for another,
 the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.”
 
 The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible
 simile; and the beadle went on.
 
 “I never,” said Mr. Bumble, “see anything like the pitch it’s got to.
 The day afore yesterday, a man—you have been a married woman, ma’am,
 and I may mention it to you—a man, with hardly a rag upon his back
 (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer’s door
 when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be
 relieved, Mrs. Corney. As he wouldn’t go away, and shocked the company

 I half woke up, raised myself on my arm, and drank a little water,
 looked over to where Margaret sat, but she was no longer there. I did
 not want to go to sleep again, and lay on my back thinking of what had
 been told me. “Jealous!” Why should I be jealous of Margaret Capel’s
 dead fame, of her dying memory? But perhaps it was true. I had a large
 public, made a large income, but had no recognition, no real reputation,
 was never in the “Literary Review of the Year,” was not jeered at as
 other popular writers, but only ignored. Well, I did not overrate my
 work. I never succeeded in pleasing myself. I began every book with
 unextinguishable hope, and every one fell short of my expectations.
 People wrote to me and told me I had made them laugh or cry, helped them
 through convalescence, cheered their toilsome day.
 
 “I love your ‘Flash of the Footlights.’”
 
 To repletion I had had such letters, requests for autographs, praise,
 and always: “I love your ‘Flash of the Footlights.’” Fifty-eight
 thousand copies had been sold in the six-shilling edition. I wonder what
 were the figures of Margaret Capel’s biggest seller. Under four thousand
 I knew. Little Billie Black told me, cherubic Billie, the publisher,
 with his girlish complexion and his bald head, who knew everybody and
 everything and told us even more.
 
 I was getting drowsy again, figures, confused and confusing, passing
 over the surface of my mind. Billie Black and Sir George Stanton,
 Gabriel, then Ella, a dim glance of my long-lost husband, Dennis, a
 smiling flash in the foreground; my eyes were hot with tears because of
 this short glad sight of him. Then Peter Kennedy again; awkward in his
 tweed cutaway morning coat. What did she mean by saying I was jealous of
 Peter Kennedy? I smiled in my deepening somnolence. Then there was an
 organ and children dancing, a monkey, a policeman, and the end of a
 string of absurdities in a long narrow vista. Sleep and unconsciousness
 at the end.
 
 I observed Dr. Kennedy with more interest the next few times he came to
 see me. A personable man without self-consciousness, some few years
 younger than myself, the light in his eyes was strange and fitful, and
 he talked abruptly. He was not well-read, ignorant of many things
 familiar to me, yet there was nothing of the village idiot about him
 such as I have found in many country apothecaries. He looked at me too
 long and too often, but at these times I knew he was thinking of
 Margaret Capel, comparing me with her. And I did not resent it, she was
 at least fourteen years younger than I, and I never had any pretensions
 to beauty. Dr. Kennedy had good hands, long-fingered, muscular; dark
 hair interspersed with grey covered his big head.
 
 “What are you thinking about me?” he asked.
 
 “What sort of doctor you are!” I answered with a fair amount of candour.
 “Here have I been without any one else for three or is it five weeks?
 You don’t write me prescriptions, nor tell me how I shall live, what to
 eat, drink, or avoid. You call constantly.”
 
 “Not as often as I should like,” he put in promptly. Then he smiled at
 me. “You don’t mind my coming?”
 
 “Have you found out what is the matter with me?”
 
 “I know what is the matter with you!”
 
 “Do you know I get weaker instead of stronger?”
 
 “I thought you would.”
 
 “Tell me the truth. Is there no hope for me?”
 
 “Patients ask so often for the truth. But they never want it.”
 
 “I am not like other patients. Haven’t I got a dog’s chance?” He shook
 his head.
 
 “How long?”
 
 “Months. Very likely years. No one can tell. You are full of vitality.
 If you live in the right way....”
 
 “Like this?”
 
 “More or less.”
 
 “And nothing more can be done for me?”
 
 “Rest, open air, occupation for the mind.” I thought over what he had
 just told me. I had known or guessed it before, but put into words it
 seemed different, more definite. “Not a dog’s chance.”
 
 “You think Margaret Capel and Gabriel Stanton will do me good? They are
 part of your treatment?” I asked him.
 
 “They and I,” he said. I was silent after that, silent for quite a long
 time. He was sitting beside me and put his shapely hand on mine. I did
 not withdraw it, my thoughts were fully occupied. “You know I shall do
 everything I can for you; you are a reincarnation.” He spoke with some
 emotion. “Some day I shall want to ask you something; you will know more
 about me soon. You are in touch with her.”
 
 “Do you really believe it?” I asked him. We were in the upstairs room.
 Today I had not adventured the stairs.
 
 “May I play?” he asked. It was not the first time he had played to me. I
 rather think he played well, but I know nothing of music. If he were
 talking to me through the keys he was talking to a deaf mute. I lay on
 the sofa and thought how tired I was, may even have slept. I was taking
 six grains of codein in the twenty-four hours when the prescription said
 two, and often fell asleep in the daytime without preparation or
 expectation.
 
 “I will tell you why I would do anything on earth for you,” he said,
 turning round abruptly on the piano stool. “If you want to know.” I was
 wide-awake now and surprised, for I had forgotten of what we had talked
 before I went off. “It is because you are so brave and uncomplaining.”
 
 “It isn’t true. Ask Ella. She has had an awful time with me, grumbling
 and ungrateful.”
 
 “Your sister adores you, thinks there is no one like you.”
 
 “That is merely her idiosyncrasy.”
 
 “Well! there is another reason. You asked for it and you are going to be
 told. The love of my life was Margaret Capel.” He stared at me when he
 said it. “You remind me of her all the time.” I shut my eyes. When I
 opened them again his back was all I saw and he was again playing
 softly; talking at the same time. “When I came here, the first time, the
 first day, and saw you sitting in her chair, at her table, in her
 attitude, as I said, it was a reincarnation.” He got up from the music
 stool and came over to me. He said, without preliminary or excuse, “You
 are taking opium in some form or other.”
 
 “I am taking my medicine.”
 
 “I am not blaming you. You’ve read De Quincey, haven’t you? You know his
 theory?”
 
 “Some of it.”
 
 “Never mind; perhaps you’ve missed it, better if you have. In those days
 it was often thought that opium cured consumption.”
 
 “Then it is consumption?”
 
 “What does it matter what we call it? Pleurisy, as you have had it,
 generally means tubercle. But you will hang on a long time. The life of
 Margaret Capel must be written and by you. She always wanted it written.
 From what you tell me she still wants it. I poured my life at her feet
 those few months she was here, but she never gave me a thought, not
 until the end. Then, then at the last, I held her eyes, her thoughts,
 her bewildered questioning eyes. Bewildered or grateful? Shall I ever
 know? Will you tell me, I wonder, hear it from her, reassure me....” He
 stopped. “I suppose you think I am mad?”
 
 “I have never thought you quite sane. But,” I added consolingly, “that
 is better than being merely stupid, like most doctors. So you regard
 me,” I could not help my tone being bitter, “as a clairvoyante,
 expectantly....”
 
 “Does any man ever care for a woman except expectantly, or
 retrospectively?”
 
 “How should I know?” He sat down by my side.
 
 “No one should know better. Tell me more about yourself, I have only
 heard from Mrs. Lovegrove.”
 
 “She told you, I suppose, that I had a great and growing reputation, had
 faithful lovers sighing for me, that I was thirty-eight....”
 
 “She told me a great deal more than that.”
 
 “I have no doubt. Well! in the first place I am not thirty-eight, but
 forty-two. My books sell, but the literary papers ignore them. I make
 enough for myself and Dennis.”
 
 “Dennis?” His tone was surprised.
 
 “Ella never mentioned Dennis to you?”
 
 “No.”
 
 I did not want to talk about Dennis. Since he had left me I never wanted
 to talk of him. His long absence had meant pain from the first, then
 agony. Afterwards the agony became physical, and they called it
 neuritis. Now it has pierced some vital part and I don’t even know what
 they call it. Decline, consumption, tuberculosis? What does it matter?
 In the two years he had been away my heart had bled to death. That was
 the truth and the whole truth. No one knew my trouble and I had spoken
 of it to nobody save once, in early days, to Ella. Ella indignantly had
 said the boy was selfish to leave me, and so closed my confidence. It is
 natural our children should wish to leave us, they make their trial
 flights, like the birds, joyously. My son wanted to see the world,
 escape from thraldom, try his wings. But I had only this one. And it
 seemed to me from his letters that he was never out of danger, now with
 malaria, and in Australia with smallpox. The last time I heard he had
 been caught in a typhoon. After that my health declined rapidly. But it
 was not his fault.
 
 “And Dennis?”
 
 “Since you know so much you can hear the rest. I married at eighteen. I
 forget what my husband was like. I’ve no recollection of his ever having
 interested me particularly. Married life itself I abhorred, I abhor. But
 it gave me Dennis. My husband died when I was two-and-twenty. Ever since
 Ella has been trying to remarry me. But when one writes, and has a
 son——” I could talk no more.
 
 “You are tired now.”
 
 “I am always tired. Why do you say years? You mean months, surely?”
 
 “You will write one more book.”
 
 “Still harping on Margaret?”
 
 “Let me carry you into your room; I have so often carried her.”
 
 “Physically at least I am a bigger woman than she was.”
 
 “A little heavier, not much.”
 
 “Well, give me your arm, help me. I don’t need to be carried.” I leaned
 on his arm. “We will talk more about your Margaret another day. I
 daresay I shall write her story. Not using all the letters, people are
 bored with letters. I am myself. And I am not sure about the copyright
 acts!”
 
 “You will give them back to me when you have done with them?”
 
 “Why not?”
 
 Benham bullied him for having let me sit up so late. My illness was
 deepening upon me so quietly, so imperceptibly that I had forgotten I
 once resented her overbearing ways. Now I depended on her for many
 things. Suzanne had gone, finding the house too _triste_, and seeing no
 possibility of further emolument from my neglected wardrobe. Benham did
 everything for me; yawningly at night, but willingly in the day.
 
 I was desperately homesick for Ella this evening. I wondered what she
 would say when she knew what Dr. Kennedy had told me. I cried again a
 little because he said I had not a dog’s chance, but was quickly
 ashamed. Why should I cry? I was so hopelessly tired. The restfulness of
 Death began to appeal to me. Not to have to get up and go to bed, dress
 and undress daily, drag myself from room to room. I had not done all my
 work, but like an idle child I wanted to be excused from doing any more.
 I was in bed and my mind wandered a little. Why was not Ella here? It
 seemed cruel she should have left me at such a time. But of course she
 did not know that I was going to die. Well! I would tell her, then she
 would come, would stay with me to the end. I forgot Margaret and Gabriel
 Stanton, two ghosts who walked at night. No extra codein for me any
 more. I no longer wanted to dream, only to face what was before me with
 courage. My writing-block was by my side and pencils, one of Ella’s last
 gifts, and I drew them toward me. I had to break to her that if she
 would be lonely in the world without me, then it was time for her to
 prepare for loneliness. I wanted to break it to her gently, but for the
 life of me I could not think, with pencil in my hand and writing-block
 before me, of any other way than that of the man who, bidden to break
 gently to a woman that her husband was dead, had called up to the window
 from the garden: “Good-morning, Widow Brown.” So I started my farewell
 letter to Ella:
 
 “Good-morning, Widow Lovegrove.”
 
 I never got any further. The hæmorrhage broke out again and I rang for
 Benham. She came yawning, buttoning up her dressing-gown, pushing back
 her undressed hair, but when she saw what was happening her whole note
 changed. This time I was neither alarmed nor confused, even watching her
 with interest. She rang for more help, got ice, gave rapid instructions
 about telephoning for a doctor.
 
 “Will you wait for an injection until he comes, or would you like me to
 give it to you?”
 
 “You.”
 
 “Very well, lie quite quiet, I shan’t be a minute.”
 
 I lay as quietly as circumstances would allow whilst she brewed her
 witches’ broth.
 
 “What dreams may come.”
 
 “Hush, do keep quiet.”
 
 “Mind you give me enough.”
 
 “I shall give you the same dose he does, a quarter of a grain.”
 
 “It won’t stop it this time.”
 
 “Oh, yes! it will.”
 
 She gave the injection as well, or better than Dr. Kennedy. I hardly
 felt the prick, and when she rubbed the place, so cleverly and gently,
 she almost made a suffragist of me. Women who did things so well
 deserved the vote.
 
 “Do you want the vote?” I asked her feebly.
 
 “I want you to lie quite still,” was her inappropriate answer. I seemed
 to be wasting words. The room was slowly filling with the scent of
 flowers. When I shut my eyes I saw growing pots of hyacinth, then
 lilies, floating in deep glass bowls, afterwards Suzanne came in, and
 began folding up my clothes, in her fat lethargic way.
 
 “I thought Suzanne went away.”
 
 “So she did.”
 
 “Who is in the room, then?”
 
 “No one. Only you and I.”
 
 “And Dr. Kennedy?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “You have sent for him?”
 
 “I thought you wouldn’t care for me to give you a morphia injection.”
 
 “Why not? You give it better than he does. I want to see him when he
 comes.”
 
 “You may be asleep.”
 
 “No! I shan’t. Morphia keeps me awake, comfortably awake. De Quincey
 used to go to the opera when he was full up with it.”
 
 Peter Kennedy came in, and I followed the line of my own thoughts. I was
 feeling drowsy.
 
 “I don’t want you to play for me,” I said, a little pettishly perhaps.
 “I should never have gone to the opera.”
 
 “All right, I won’t.” He asked nurse in a low voice, “How much did you
 give her?”
 
 “A quarter of a grain, the same as before.” The bleeding had not left
 off. Benham straightened me amongst the pillows and fed me with ice.
 
 “I shall give her another quarter,” he said abruptly after watching for
 a few minutes. I smiled gratefully at him. Benham made no comment, but
 got more hot water. He made the injection carefully enough, but I
 preferred nurse’s manipulation.
 
 “For Margaret?” I asked him.
 
 “Partly,” he answered. “You will dream tonight.”
 
 “I shall die tonight. I want to die tonight. Give me something to hurry
 things, be kind. I don’t mind dying, but all this!”
 
 “Don’t. I can’t. Not again. For God’s sake don’t ask me!” There was more
 than sympathy in his voice. There was agitation, even tears. “You will
 get better from this.”
 
 “And then worse again, always worse. I want it ended. Give me
 something.”
 
 “Oh! God! I can’t bear this. Margaret!”
 
 “Don’t call me Margaret. My name is Jane. What is that stuff that
 criminals take in the dock? Italian poisoners keep it in a ring. I see
 one now, with pointed beard, melancholy eyes, a great ruby in the ring.
 Is anything the matter with my eyes? I can’t see.”
 
 “Shut them. Be perfectly quiet. The Italian poisoner will pass.”
 
 “You will give me something?”
 
 “Not this time.”
 
 I must have slept. When I woke he was still there. I was very
 comfortable and pleased to see him. “Why am I not asleep?”
 
 “You are, but you don’t know it.”
 
 “You won’t tell Ella?”
 
 “Not unless you wish it.”
 
 “I’ve written to her. See it goes.” I heard afterwards he searched for a
 letter, but could only find four words “Good-morning, Widow
 Lovegrove ...” which held no meaning for him.
 
 “Don’t let me wake again. I want to go.”
 
 “Not yet, not yet....”
 
 There followed another week of morphia dreams and complete content. I
 was roused with difficulty, and reluctantly, to drink milk from a
 feeding-cup, to have my temperature taken, my hands and face washed, my
 sheets changed. There was neither morning nor evening, only these
 disturbances and Ella’s eyes and voice in the clouded distance, vague
 yet comforting.
 
 “You will soon be better, your temperature is going down. Don’t speak.
 Only nod your head. Shall I cable for Dennis?”
 
 I shook it, went on slowly shaking it, I liked the motion, turning from
 side to side on the pillow, continuing it. Ella, frightened, begged me
 to leave off, summoned nurse, who took my cheeks gently between her
 hands. That did not stop it, at least I recollect being angry at the
 slight compulsion and making up my mind, my poor lost feeble mind that I
 should do what I liked, that I would never leave off moving my head from
 side to side.
 
 That night I dreamed of water, great masses of black water, heaving; too
 deep for sound or foam. Upon them I was borne backwards and forwards
 until I turned giddy and sick, very cold. The Gates of Silence were
 beyond, but I was too weak to get there, the bar was between us. I saw
 the Gates, but could not reach them. The waters were cold and ever
 rising. Sometimes, submerged, my lips tasted their dank saltness and I
 knew that my strength was all spent. Soon I should sink deeper. I wished
 it was over.
 
 Then One came, when I was past help, or hope, drowning in the dark
 waters, and said:
 
 “Now I will take you with me.” We were going rapidly through air
 currents, soft warm air-currents and amazing space, a swift journey,
 over plains and mountains. At last to the North, and there I saw
 snow-mountains and at the foot the cold sea, frozen and blue, heaving
 slowly. Swimming in that slow frozen sea, I saw a seal, brown and
 beautiful, swimming calmly, with happy handsome eyes. They met mine. One
 who was beside me said:
 
 “That is your sister Julia. See how happy she looks, and content....”
 
 Then everything was gone and I woke up in my quiet bedroom, the fire
 burning low and Ella in the chair by my side.
 
 “Do you want anything?” She leaned over me for the answer.
 
 “I have just seen Julia.”
 
 She hushed me, tears were in her reddened eyes. Our sister Julia had
 been dead two years, to our unextinguishable sorrow.
 
 “Don’t cry, she is very happy.”
 
 I told her my dream. She said it was a beautiful dream, and I was to try
 and sleep again.
 
 “Why are you sitting up?” I asked her.
 
 “It is not late,” was her evasive reply.
 
 Many nights after that I saw her sitting there, I forgot even to ask her
 why, I was too far gone, or perhaps only selfish. I did not know for a
 long time whether it was night or day. I always asked the time when I
 woke, but forgot or did not hear the answer, drank obediently through
 the feeding-cup,—the feeding-cup was always there; enormously large,
 unnaturally white, holding little or nothing, unsatisfactory. Once I
 remember I decided upon remaining awake to tell poor Ella how much
 better I felt....
 
 I told it to Margaret instead, and she had no interest in the news, none
 at all.
 
 “I knew you were not going to die yet. Not until you had written my
 story.”
 
 “It seems not to matter,” I answered feebly, “to be small and trivial.”
 
 “_Work whilst ye have the light_,” she quoted. The words were in the
 room, in the air.
 
 “It is not light, not very light,” I pleaded.
 
 “There has been no biography of me. How would you like it if it had been
 you? And all the critics said I would live....”
 
 “Must I stay for that?”
 
 “You promised, you know.”
 
 “Did I? I had forgotten.”
 
 “No, no. You could not forget, not even you. And you will make your
 readers cry.”
 
 “But if I make myself cry too?”
 
 “Write.”
 
 And I wrote, sick with exhaustion, without conscious volition or the
 power to stop. I wonder whether any other writer has ever had this
 experience. I could not stop writing although my arm swelled to an
 unnatural size and my side ached. I covered ream after ream of paper. I
 never stopped nor halted for word or thought. I was wearied, aching from
 head to foot, shaking and even crying with fatigue and the pain in my
 swollen arm or side, but never ceasing to write, like a galley slave at
 his oar. Sometimes in swimming semi-consciousness I thought this was my
 eternal punishment, that because I had swept so much aside that I might
 write, and yet had written badly, now I must write for ever and for
 ever, words and scenes and sentences that would be obliterated, that
 would not stand. I knew in these semi-conscious moments that I was
 writing in water and not in ink. But I was driven on, and on,
 relentlessly.
 
 
 
 
                               CHAPTER VIII
 
 
 Here is the story I wrote under morphia and in that strange driving
 stress, set down as well as I can recall it, but seeming now so much
 less real and distinct. I have not tried to polish, only to remember.
 There was then no effort after composition, no correction, transposition
 nor alteration, and neither is there now; nor conscious psychology nor
 sentiment. The scenes were all set in the house where I lay, and there
 was no pause in the continuity of the drama. I saw every gesture and
 heard every word spoken. The letters were and are before me as
 confirmatory evidence. My own intrusive illness minimised the interest
 of the circumstances to my immediate surroundings. But to me it seems
 that the consecutive actuality of the morphia dream or dreams is unusual
 if not unique, and gives value to the narrative.
 
 I refer to the MS. notes and diary for the beginning of the story, but
 have had to make several emendations and additions. There were too many
 epigrams, and the impression the writer wished to convey was only in the
 intention, and not in the execution. What she left out I have put in. It
",Twilight
24," were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet
 air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined
 in the cab my mission was practically accomplished, and for the rest,
 I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend
 in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of
 his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s
 bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness.
 In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium
 den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two
 streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then,
 glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a
 hearty fit of laughter.
 
 “I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added
 opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
 weaknesses on which you have favored me with your medical views.”
 
 “I was certainly surprised to find you there.”
 
 “But not more so than I to find you.”
 
 “I came to find a friend.”
 
 “And I to find an enemy.”
 
 “An enemy?”
 
 “Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.
 Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and
 I have hoped to find a clew in the incoherent ramblings of these
 sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognized in that den my
 life would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it
 before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has
 sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of
 that building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some
 strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”
 
 “What! You do not mean bodies?”
 
 “Aye, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £1000 for every
 poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest
 murder-trap on the whole river-side, and I fear that Neville St. Clair
 has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.”
 He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a
 signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance,
 followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’
 hoofs.
 
 “Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the
 gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side
 lanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”
 
 “If I can be of use.”
 
 “Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.
 My room at ‘The Cedars’ is a double-bedded one.”
 
 “‘The Cedars?’”
 
 “Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct
 the inquiry.”
 
 “Where is it, then?”
 
 “Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”
 
 “But I am all in the dark.”
 
 “Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.
 All right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out
 for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”
 
 He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the
 endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened
 gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with
 the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull
 wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,
 regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some
 belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the
 sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts
 of the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
 breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside
 him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax
 his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of
 his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get
 to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,
 shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who
 has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
 
 “You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you
 quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing
 for me to have some one to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over
 pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman
 to-night when she meets me at the door.”
 
 “You forget that I know nothing about it.”
 
 “I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get
 to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow, I can get nothing
 to go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end
 of it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to
 you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”
 
 “Proceed, then.”
 
 “Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a
 gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty
 of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely,
 and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the
 neighborhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by
 whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested
 in several companies, and went into town as a rule in the morning,
 returning by the 5.14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is
 now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good
 husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all
 who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,
 as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £88 10_s._, while
 he has £220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.
 There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been
 weighing upon his mind.
 
 “Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
 than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
 commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a
 box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram
 upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect
 that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting
 was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.
 Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the offices
 of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam
 Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,
 started for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s
 office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4.35 walking
 through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed
 me so far?”
 
 “It is very clear.”
 
 “If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.
 Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as
 she did not like the neighborhood in which she found herself. While
 she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an
 ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down
 at her, and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor
 window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she
 describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically
 to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed
 to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from
 behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was
 that, although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town
 in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
 
 [Illustration: “AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS SHE MET THIS LASCAR
 SCOUNDREL.”]
 
 “Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
 steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you
 found me to-night—and, running through the front room, she attempted
 to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the
 stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,
 who thrust her back, and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,
 pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts
 and fears, she rushed down the lane, and, by rare good-fortune, met, in
 Fresno Street, a number of constables with an inspector, all on their
 way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and,
 in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their
 way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no
 sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one
 to be found, save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,
 made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one
 else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined
 was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come
 to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded, when, with a cry, she
 sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table, and tore the lid
 from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy
 which he had promised to bring home.
 
 “This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,
 made the inspector realize that the matter was serious. The rooms were
 carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime.
 The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room, and led into a
 small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.
 Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is
 dry at low tide, but is covered at high tide with at least four and
 a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one, and opened
 from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the
 window-sill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden
 floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room
 were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of
 his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there.
 There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there
 were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he
 must apparently have gone, for no other exit could be discovered, and
 the ominous blood-stains upon the sill gave little promise that he
 could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at
 the moment of the tragedy.
 
 “And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in
 the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,
 but as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the
 foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance
 at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the
 crime. His defense was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that
 he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and
 that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
 gentleman’s clothes.
 
 “So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives
 upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the
 last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name
 is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every
 man who goes much to the city. He is a professional beggar, though,
 in order to avoid the police regulations, he pretends to a small
 trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street,
 upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small
 angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
 cross-legged, with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and, as he is
 a piteous spectacle, a small rain of charity descends into the greasy
 leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the
 fellow more than once, before ever I thought of making his professional
 acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has
 reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that
 no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a
 pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction,
 has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bull-dog chin, and a
 pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast
 to the color of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common
 crowd of mendicants, and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready
 with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the
 passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger
 at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of
 whom we are in quest.”
 
 “But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done single-handed against
 a man in the prime of life?”
 
 “He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other
 respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your
 medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is
 often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”
 
 “Pray continue your narrative.”
 
 “Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,
 and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence
 could be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton,
 who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the
 premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the
 matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as
 he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated
 with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he
 was seized and searched, without anything being found which could
 incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his
 right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
 cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,
 adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the
 stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same
 source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair,
 and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much
 a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion
 that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that
 she must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly
 protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon
 the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh
 clew.
 
 “And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had
 feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.
 Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think
 they found in the pockets?”
 
 “I cannot imagine.”
 
 “No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies
 and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder
 that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a
 different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the
 house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when
 the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”
 
 “But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.
 Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?”
 
 “No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that
 this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there
 is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?
 It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the
 tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of
 throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not
 sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle down-stairs when
 the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard
 from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
 There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret horde,
 where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all
 the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure
 of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same
 with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and
 only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”
 
 “It certainly sounds feasible.”
 
 “Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.
 Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but
 it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against
 him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life
 appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter
 stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what
 Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him
 when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his
 disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I
 cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
 glance so simple, and yet which presented such difficulties.”
 
 While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
 events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town
 until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled
 along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,
 however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights
 still glimmered in the windows.
 
 “We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched
 on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,
 passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light
 among the trees? That is ‘The Cedars,’ and beside that lamp sits a
 woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the
 clink of our horse’s feet.”
 
 “But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I asked.
 
 “Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs.
 St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may
 rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend
 and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her
 husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!”
 
 We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own
 grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and, springing
 down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to
 the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde
 woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de
 soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She
 stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand
 upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly
 bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a
 standing question.
 
 “Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of
 us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my
 companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
 
 “No good news?”
 
 “None.”
 
 “No bad?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a
 long day.”
 
 “This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in
 several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to
 bring him out and associate him with this investigation.”
 
 “I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly.
 “You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
 arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly
 upon us.”
 
 “My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not,
 I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any
 assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed
 happy.”
 
 “Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady, as we entered a well-lit
 dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,
 “I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to
 which I beg that you will give a plain answer.”
 
 “Certainly, madam.”
 
 “Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to
 fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”
 
 “Upon what point?”
 
 “In your heart of hearts do you think that Neville is alive?”
 
 Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly,
 now!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at
 him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
 
 “Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”
 
 “You think that he is dead?”
 
 “I do.”
 
 “Murdered?”
 
 “I don’t say that. Perhaps.”
 
 “And on what day did he meet his death?”
 
 “On Monday.”
 
 “Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is
 that I have received a letter from him to-day.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanized.
 
 “What!” he roared.
 
 “Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in
 the air.
 
 “May I see it?”
 
 “Certainly.”
 
 He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon
 the table, he drew over the lamp, and examined it intently. I had left
 my chair, and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a
 very coarse one, and was stamped with the Gravesend post-mark, and with
 the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was
 considerably after midnight.
 
 “Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s
 writing, madam.”
 
 “No, but the enclosure is.”
 
 “I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and
 inquire as to the address.”
 
 “How can you tell that?”
 
 “The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.
 The rest is of the grayish color, which shows that blotting-paper has
 been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none
 would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and
 there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only
 mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but
 there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.
 Ha! there has been an enclosure here!”
 
 “Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”
 
 “And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”
 
 “One of his hands.”
 
 “One?”
 
 “His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,
 and yet I know it well.”
 
 “‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a
 huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in
 patience.—Neville.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,
 octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man
 with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very
 much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have
 no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”
 
 “None. Neville wrote those words.”
 
 “And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the
 clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is
 over.”
 
 “But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”
 
 “Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The
 ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”
 
 “No, no; it is, it is, it is his very own writing!”
 
 “Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday, and only
 posted to-day.”
 
 “That is possible.”
 
 “If so, much may have happened between.”
 
 “Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well
 with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if
 evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself
 in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed up-stairs instantly
 with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think
 that I would respond to such a trifle, and yet be ignorant of his
 death?”
 
 “I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may
 be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And
 in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to
 corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive, and able to write
 letters, why should he remain away from you?”
 
 “I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”
 
 “And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”
 
 “Very much so.”
 
 “Was the window open?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Then he might have called to you?”
 
 “He might.”
 
 “He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “A call for help, you thought?”
 
 “Yes. He waved his hands.”
 
 “But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
 unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”
 
 “It is possible.”
 
 “And you thought he was pulled back?”
 
 “He disappeared so suddenly.”
 
 “He might have leaped back. You did not see any one else in the room?”
 
 “No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the
 Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.”
 
 “Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary
 clothes on?”
 
 “But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”
 
 “Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”
 
 “Never.”
 
 “Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”
 
 “Never.”
 
 “Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which
 I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and
 then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”
 
 A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
 disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after
 my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when
 he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even
 for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts,
 looking at it from every point of view, until he had either fathomed
 it, or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon
 evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He
 took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown,
 and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and
 cushions from the sofa and arm-chairs. With these he constructed a sort
 of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an
 ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.
 In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar
 pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the
 ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with
 the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I
 dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me
 to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The
 pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the
 room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap
 of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
 
 “Awake, Watson?” he asked.
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Game for a morning drive?”
 
 “Certainly.”
 
 “Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy
 sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself
 as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the
 sombre thinker of the previous night.
 
 As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was
 stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished
 when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the
 horse.
 
 “I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his
 boots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of
 one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from
 here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”
 
 “And where is it?” I asked, smiling.
 
 “In the bath-room,” he answered. “Oh yes, I am not joking,” he
 continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and
 I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,
 my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”
 
 We made our way down-stairs as quietly as possible, and out into the
 bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with
 the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and
 away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,
 bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on
 either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
 
 “It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the
 horse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole,
 but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”
 
 In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from
 their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.
 Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and
 dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right, and found
 ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the Force,
 and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the
 horse’s head while the other led us in.
 
 “Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.
",Holmes
25," says the vagrant. ‘Oh no, you won’t,’ says our overseer.”
 
 “Ha! ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn’t it?”
 interposed the matron. “Well, Mr. Bumble?”
 
 “Well, ma’am,” rejoined the beadle, “he went away; and he _did_ die in
 the streets. There’s a obstinate pauper for you!”
 
 “It beats anything I could have believed,” observed the matron
 emphatically. “But don’t you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing,
 any way, Mr. Bumble? You’re a gentleman of experience, and ought to
 know. Come.”
 
 “Mrs. Corney,” said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious
 of superior information, “out-of-door relief, properly managed:
 properly managed, ma’am: is the porochial safeguard. The great
 principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what
 they don’t want; and then they get tired of coming.”
 
 “Dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Corney. “Well, that is a good one, too!”
 
 “Yes. Betwixt you and me, ma’am,” returned Mr. Bumble, “that’s the
 great principle; and that’s the reason why, if you look at any cases
 that get into them owdacious newspapers, you’ll always observe that
 sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese. That’s the rule
 now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,” said the beadle,
 stopping to unpack his bundle, “these are official secrets, ma’am; not
 to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers,
 such as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma’am, that the board ordered
 for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask
 this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!”
 
 Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to
 test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of
 drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it
 carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.
 
 “You’ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,” said the matron.
 
 “It blows, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar,
 “enough to cut one’s ears off.”
 
 The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was
 moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to
 bidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether—whether he wouldn’t
 take a cup of tea?
 
 Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat
 and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. As he
 slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady. She fixed her eyes upon
 the little teapot. Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.
 
 Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she
 sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle;
 she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea. Again
 Mr. Bumble coughed—louder this time than he had coughed yet.
 
 “Sweet? Mr. Bumble?” inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin.
 
 “Very sweet, indeed, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble. He fixed his eyes on
 Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr.
 Bumble was that beadle at that moment.
 
 The tea was made, and handed in silence. Mr. Bumble, having spread a
 handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the
 splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these
 amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had
 no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather
 seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.
 
 “You have a cat, ma’am, I see,” said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who,
 in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; “and kittens
 too, I declare!”
 
 “I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can’t think,” replied the
 matron. “They’re _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that
 they are quite companions for me.”
 
 “Very nice animals, ma’am,” replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; “so very
 domestic.”
 
 “Oh, yes!” rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; “so fond of their home
 too, that it’s quite a pleasure, I’m sure.”
 
 “Mrs. Corney, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time
 with his teaspoon, “I mean to say this, ma’am; that any cat, or kitten,
 that could live with you, ma’am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be
 a ass, ma’am.”
 
 “Oh, Mr. Bumble!” remonstrated Mrs. Corney.
 
 “It’s of no use disguising facts, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble, slowly
 flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him
 doubly impressive; “I would drown it myself, with pleasure.”
 
 “Then you’re a cruel man,” said the matron vivaciously, as she held out
 her hand for the beadle’s cup; “and a very hard-hearted man besides.”
 
 “Hard-hearted, ma’am?” said Mr. Bumble. “Hard?” Mr. Bumble resigned his
 cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney’s little finger as she
 took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat,
 gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther
 from the fire.
 
 It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been
 sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and
 fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from
 the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance
 between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers
 will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great
 heroism on Mr. Bumble’s part: he being in some sort tempted by time,
 place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,
 which however well they may become the lips of the light and
 thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the
 land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other
 great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the
 stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be
 the sternest and most inflexible among them all.
 
 Whatever were Mr. Bumble’s intentions, however (and no doubt they were
 of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before
 remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble,
 moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the
 distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel
 round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close
 to that in which the matron was seated.
 
 Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble
 stopped.
 
 Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have
 been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen
 into Mr. Bumble’s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt
 foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was,
 and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.
 
 “Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?” said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and
 looking up into the matron’s face; “are _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs.
 Corney?”
 
 “Dear me!” exclaimed the matron, “what a very curious question from a
 single man. What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?”
 
 The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast;
 whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately
 kissed the matron.
 
 “Mr. Bumble!” cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was
 so great, that she had quite lost her voice, “Mr. Bumble, I shall
 scream!” Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner,
 put his arm round the matron’s waist.
 
 As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would
 have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was
 rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no
 sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine
 bottles, and began dusting them with great violence: while the matron
 sharply demanded who was there.
 
 It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy
 of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that
 her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity.
 
 “If you please, mistress,” said a withered old female pauper, hideously
 ugly: putting her head in at the door, “Old Sally is a-going fast.”
 
 “Well, what’s that to me?” angrily demanded the matron. “I can’t keep
 her alive, can I?”
 
 “No, no, mistress,” replied the old woman, “nobody can; she’s far
 beyond the reach of help. I’ve seen a many people die; little babes and
 great strong men; and I know when death’s a-coming, well enough. But
 she’s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,—and
 that’s not often, for she is dying very hard,—she says she has got
 something to tell, which you must hear. She’ll never die quiet till you
 come, mistress.”
 
 At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of
 invectives against old women who couldn’t even die without purposely
 annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which
 she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she
 came back, lest anything particular should occur. Bidding the messenger
 walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed
 her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.
 
 Mr. Bumble’s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.
 He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs,
 closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the
 genuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put
 on his cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four
 distinct times round the table.
 
 Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off
 the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his
 back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact
 inventory of the furniture.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXIV.
 TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF
 IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY
 
 
 It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the
 matron’s room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy;
 her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque
 shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature’s hand.
 
 Alas! How few of Nature’s faces are left alone to gladden us with their
 beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change
 them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep,
 and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off,
 and leave Heaven’s surface clear. It is a common thing for the
 countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to
 subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and
 settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they
 grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by
 the coffin’s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.
 
 The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering
 some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at
 length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand,
 and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble
 superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay.
 
 It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end.
 There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish
 apothecary’s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick
 out of a quill.
 
 “Cold night, Mrs. Corney,” said this young gentleman, as the matron
 entered.
 
 “Very cold, indeed, sir,” replied the mistress, in her most civil
 tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.
 
 “You should get better coals out of your contractors,” said the
 apothecary’s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the
 rusty poker; “these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.”
 
 “They’re the board’s choosing, sir,” returned the matron. “The least
 they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard
 enough.”
 
 The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.
 
 “Oh!” said the young man, turning his face towards the bed, as if he
 had previously quite forgotten the patient, “it’s all U.P. there, Mrs.
 Corney.”
 
 “It is, is it, sir?” asked the matron.
 
 “If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,” said the
 apothecary’s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick’s point. “It’s a
 break-up of the system altogether. Is she dozing, old lady?”
 
 The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the
 affirmative.
 
 “Then perhaps she’ll go off in that way, if you don’t make a row,” said
 the young man. “Put the light on the floor. She won’t see it there.”
 
 The attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to
 intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she
 resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time
 returned. The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped
 herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed.
 
 The apothecary’s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the
 toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it
 for ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished
 Mrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.
 
 When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from
 the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to
 catch the heat. The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled
 faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position,
 they began to converse in a low voice.
 
 “Did she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?” inquired the
 messenger.
 
 “Not a word,” replied the other. “She plucked and tore at her arms for
 a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. She
 hasn’t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet. I ain’t so
 weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!”
 
 “Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?” demanded
 the first.
 
 “I tried to get it down,” rejoined the other. “But her teeth were tight
 set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do
 to get it back again. So I drank it; and it did me good!”
 
 Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard,
 the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.
 
 “I mind the time,” said the first speaker, “when she would have done
 the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.”
 
 “Ay, that she would,” rejoined the other; “she had a merry heart. “A
 many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as
 waxwork. My old eyes have seen them—ay, and those old hands touched
 them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.”
 
 Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature
 shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket,
 brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook
 a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few
 more into her own. While they were thus employed, the matron, who had
 been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her
 stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to
 wait?
 
 “Not long, mistress,” replied the second woman, looking up into her
 face. “We have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience!
 He’ll be here soon enough for us all.”
 
 “Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!” said the matron sternly. “You,
 Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?”
 
 “Often,” answered the first woman.
 
 “But will never be again,” added the second one; “that is, she’ll never
 wake again but once—and mind, mistress, that won’t be for long!”
 
 “Long or short,” said the matron, snappishly, “she won’t find me here
 when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for
 nothing. It’s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house
 die, and I won’t—that’s more. Mind that, you impudent old harridans. If
 you make a fool of me again, I’ll soon cure you, I warrant you!”
 
 She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned
 towards the bed, caused her to look round. The patient had raised
 herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them.
 
 “Who’s that?” she cried, in a hollow voice.
 
 “Hush, hush!” said one of the women, stooping over her. “Lie down, lie
 down!”
 
 “I’ll never lie down again alive!” said the woman, struggling. “I
 _will_ tell her! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in your ear.”
 
 She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the
 bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of
 the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.
 
 “Turn them away,” said the woman, drowsily; “make haste! make haste!”
 
 The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous
 lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best
 friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never
 leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the
 door, and returned to the bedside. On being excluded, the old ladies
 changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was
 drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a
 moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring
 under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been
 privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy
 old ladies themselves.
 
 “Now listen to me,” said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great
 effort to revive one latent spark of energy. “In this very room—in this
 very bed—I once nursed a pretty young creetur’, that was brought into
 the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled
 with dust and blood. She gave birth to a boy, and died. Let me
 think—what was the year again!”
 
 “Never mind the year,” said the impatient auditor; “what about her?”
 
 “Ay,” murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state,
 “what about her?—what about—I know!” she cried, jumping fiercely up:
 her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head—“I robbed her, so
 I did! She wasn’t cold—I tell you she wasn’t cold, when I stole it!”
 
 “Stole what, for God’s sake?” cried the matron, with a gesture as if
 she would call for help.
 
 “_It_!” replied the woman, laying her hand over the other’s mouth. “The
 only thing she had. She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to
 eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom. It was gold, I
 tell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!”
 
 “Gold!” echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell
 back. “Go on, go on—yes—what of it? Who was the mother? When was it?”
 
 “She charged me to keep it safe,” replied the woman with a groan, “and
 trusted me as the only woman about her. I stole it in my heart when she
 first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child’s death,
 perhaps, is on me besides! They would have treated him better, if they
 had known it all!”
 
 “Known what?” asked the other. “Speak!”
 
 “The boy grew so like his mother,” said the woman, rambling on, and not
 heeding the question, “that I could never forget it when I saw his
 face. Poor girl! poor girl! She was so young, too! Such a gentle lamb!
 Wait; there’s more to tell. I have not told you all, have I?”
 
 “No, no,” replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as
 they came more faintly from the dying woman. “Be quick, or it may be
 too late!”
 
 “The mother,” said the woman, making a more violent effort than before;
 “the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in
 my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come
 when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother
 named. ‘And oh, kind Heaven!’ she said, folding her thin hands
 together, ‘whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in
 this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child,
 abandoned to its mercy!’”
 
 “The boy’s name?” demanded the matron.
 
 “They _called_ him Oliver,” replied the woman, feebly. “The gold I
 stole was—”
 
 “Yes, yes—what?” cried the other.
 
 She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew
 back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a
 sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered
 some indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.
 
 
 “Stone dead!” said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the
 door was opened.
 
 “And nothing to tell, after all,” rejoined the matron, walking
 carelessly away.
 
 The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the
 preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left
 alone, hovering about the body.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXV.
 WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY
 
 
 While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat
 in the old den—the same from which Oliver had been removed by the
 girl—brooding over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair of bellows upon
 his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it
 into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and
 with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed
 his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.
 
 At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and
 Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy
 against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the
 first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired
 great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and
 his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling’s hand; upon which, from time to
 time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances:
 wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon
 his neighbour’s cards. It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat,
 as, indeed, was often his custom within doors. He also sustained a clay
 pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he
 deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the
 table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the
 accommodation of the company.
 
 Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more
 excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that
 he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover
 indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a
 scientific rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close
 attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his
 companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master
 Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to
 be “blowed,” or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some
 other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application
 of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling.
 It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably
 lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates,
 appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed
 most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had
 never seen such a jolly game in all his born days.
 
 “That’s two doubles and the rub,” said Mr. Chitling, with a very long
 face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket. “I never see
 such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything. Even when we’ve good
 cards, Charley and I can’t make nothing of ’em.”
 
 Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very
 ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of
 laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire
 what was the matter.
 
 “Matter, Fagin!” cried Charley. “I wish you had watched the play. Tommy
 Chitling hasn’t won a point; and I went partners with him against the
 Artfull and dumb.”
 
 “Ay, ay!” said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated
 that he was at no loss to understand the reason. “Try ’em again, Tom;
 try ’em again.”
 
 “No more of it for me, thank ’ee, Fagin,” replied Mr. Chitling; “I’ve
 had enough. That ’ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there’s no
 standing again’ him.”
 
 “Ha! ha! my dear,” replied the Jew, “you must get up very early in the
 morning, to win against the Dodger.”
 
 “Morning!” said Charley Bates; “you must put your boots on over-night,
 and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your
 shoulders, if you want to come over him.”
 
 Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy,
 and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first
 picture-card, at a shilling at a time. Nobody accepting the challenge,
 and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse
 himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the
 piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling,
 meantime, with peculiar shrillness.
 
 “How precious dull you are, Tommy!” said the Dodger, stopping short
 when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. “What
 do you think he’s thinking of, Fagin?”
 
 “How should I know, my dear?” replied the Jew, looking round as he
 plied the bellows. “About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement
 in the country that he’s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that it, my dear?”
 
 “Not a bit of it,” replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of
 discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. “What do _you_ say,
 Charley?”
 
 “_I_ should say,” replied Master Bates, with a grin, “that he was
 uncommon sweet upon Betsy. See how he’s a-blushing! Oh, my eye! here’s
 a merry-go-rounder! Tommy Chitling’s in love! Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a
 spree!”
 
 Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim
 of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair
 with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the
 floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at
 full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former
 position, and began another laugh.
 
 “Never mind him, my dear,” said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and
 giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.
 “Betsy’s a fine girl. Stick up to her, Tom. Stick up to her.”
 
 “What I mean to say, Fagin,” replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the
 face, “is, that that isn’t anything to anybody here.”
 
 “No more it is,” replied the Jew; “Charley will talk. Don’t mind him,
 my dear; don’t mind him. Betsy’s a fine girl. Do as she bids you, Tom,
 and you will make your fortune.”
 
 “So I _do_ do as she bids me,” replied Mr. Chitling; “I shouldn’t have
 been milled, if it hadn’t been for her advice. But it turned out a good
 job for you; didn’t it, Fagin! And what’s six weeks of it? It must
 come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you
 don’t want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?”
 
 “Ah, to be sure, my dear,” replied the Jew.
 
 “You wouldn’t mind it again, Tom, would you,” asked the Dodger, winking
 upon Charley and the Jew, “if Bet was all right?”
 
 “I mean to say that I shouldn’t,” replied Tom, angrily. “There, now.
 Ah! Who’ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?”
 
 “Nobody, my dear,” replied the Jew; “not a soul, Tom. I don’t know one
 of ’em that would do it besides you; not one of ’em, my dear.”
 
 “I might have got clear off, if I’d split upon her; mightn’t I, Fagin?”
 angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. “A word from me would have
 done it; wouldn’t it, Fagin?”
 
 “To be sure it would, my dear,” replied the Jew.
 
 “But I didn’t blab it; did I, Fagin?” demanded Tom, pouring question
 upon question with great volubility.
 
 “No, no, to be sure,” replied the Jew; “you were too stout-hearted for
 that. A deal too stout, my dear!”
 
 “Perhaps I was,” rejoined Tom, looking round; “and if I was, what’s to
 laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?”
 
 The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened
 to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the
 company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. But,
 unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never
 more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a
 violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary
 ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender;
 who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose
 his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old
 gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood
 panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.
 
 “Hark!” cried the Dodger at this moment, “I heard the tinkler.”
 Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.
 
 The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in
 darkness. After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered
 Fagin mysteriously.
 
 “What!” cried the Jew, “alone?”
 
 The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the
 candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb
 show, that he had better not be funny just then. Having performed this
 friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew’s face, and awaited his
 directions.
 
 The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his
 face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and
 feared to know the worst. At length he raised his head.
 
 “Where is he?” he asked.
 
 The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to
 leave the room.
 
 “Yes,” said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; “bring him down. Hush!
 Quiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!”
 
 This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was
 softly and immediately obeyed. There was no sound of their whereabout,
 when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand,
 and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a
 hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had
 concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard,
 unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.
 
 “How are you, Faguey?” said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. “Pop that
 shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it
 when I cut; that’s the time of day! You’ll be a fine young cracksman
 afore the old file now.”
 
 With these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round
 his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.
 
 “See there, Faguey,” he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots;
 “not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of
 blacking, by Jove! But don’t look at me in that way, man. All in good
 time. I can’t talk about business till I’ve eat and drank; so produce
 the sustainance, and let’s have a quiet fill-out for the first time
 these three days!”
 
 The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon
 the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his
 leisure.
 
 To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the
 conversation. At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently
 watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue
 to the intelligence he brought; but in vain.
 
 He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon
 his features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and
 whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of
 flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched
 every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room,
 meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement. It was all of no use. Toby
 continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could
 eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a
 glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.
 
 “First and foremost, Faguey,” said Toby.
 
 “Yes, yes!” interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.
 
 Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to
 declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the
 low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his
 eye, he quietly resumed.
 
 “First and foremost, Faguey,” said the housebreaker, “how’s Bill?”
 
 “What!” screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.
 
 “Why, you don’t mean to say—” began Toby, turning pale.
 
 “Mean!” cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. “Where are
 they? Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where
 are they hiding? Why have they not been here?”
 
 “The crack failed,” said Toby faintly.
 
 “I know it,” replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and
 pointing to it. “What more?”
 
 “They fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with
 him between us—straight as the crow flies—through hedge and ditch. They
 gave chase. Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.”
 
 “The boy!”
 
 “Bill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to
 take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were
 close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!
 We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or
 dead, that’s all I know about him.”
 
 The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining
 his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXVI.
 IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY
 THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED
 
 
 The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover
 the effect of Toby Crackit’s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing of
 his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and
 disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a
 boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger: drove him
 back upon the pavement. Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main
 streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at length
 emerged on Snow Hill. Here he walked even faster than before; nor did
 he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious
 that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling
 pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.
 
 Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon
 the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley,
 leading to Saffron Hill. In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge
 bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns;
 for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets.
 Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the
 windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are
 piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its
 barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse.
 It is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny:
 visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants,
 who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they
 come. Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant,
 display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of
 old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and
 linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.
 
 It was into this place that the Jew turned. He was well known to the
 sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out
 to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to
 their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition
 until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to
 address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his
 person into a child’s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a
 pipe at his warehouse door.
 
 “Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!” said this
 respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew’s inquiry after his
 health.
 
 “The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,” said Fagin, elevating
 his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.
 
 “Well, I’ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,” replied
 the trader; “but it soon cools down again; don’t you find it so?”
 
 Fagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of Saffron
 Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.
 
 “At the Cripples?” inquired the man.
 
 The Jew nodded.
 
 “Let me see,” pursued the merchant, reflecting.
 
 “Yes, there’s some half-dozen of ’em gone in, that I knows. I don’t
 think your friend’s there.”
 
 “Sikes is not, I suppose?” inquired the Jew, with a disappointed
 countenance.
 
 “_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,” replied the little man, shaking
 his head, and looking amazingly sly. “Have you got anything in my line
 to-night?”
 
 “Nothing to-night,” said the Jew, turning away.
 
 “Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?” cried the little man,
 calling after him. “Stop! I don’t mind if I have a drop there with
 you!”
 
 But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he
 preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very
 easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was,
 for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively’s presence. By the
 time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively,
 after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight
 of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a
 shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and
 mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.
 
 The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which
 the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the
 public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured.
 Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight
 upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating
 himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with
 his hand, as if in search of some particular person.
 
 The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was
 prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded
 red, from being visible outside. The ceiling was blackened, to prevent
 its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the
 place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely
 possible to discern anything more. By degrees, however, as some of it
 cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused
 as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye
 grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware
 of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a
 long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of
 office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose,
 and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a
 jingling piano in a remote corner.
 
 As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over
 the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a
 song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the
 company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the
 accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could. When
 this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the
 professional gentleman on the chairman’s right and left volunteered a
 duet, and sang it, with great applause.
 
 It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from
 among the group. There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the
 house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were
 proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give
 himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and
 an ear for everything that was said—and sharp ones, too. Near him were
 the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments
 of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered
 glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous
 admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost
 every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very
 repulsiveness. Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages,
 were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last
 lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked:
 others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and
 presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere
 girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed
 the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.
 
 Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face
 while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without
 meeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in
 catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him
 slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it.
 
 “What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?” inquired the man, as he followed
 him out to the landing. “Won’t you join us? They’ll be delighted, every
 one of ’em.”
 
 The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, “Is _he_
 here?”
 
 “No,” replied the man.
 
 “And no news of Barney?” inquired Fagin.
 
 “None,” replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. “He won’t
 stir till it’s all safe. Depend on it, they’re on the scent down there;
 and that if he moved, he’d blow upon the thing at once. He’s all right
 enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him. I’ll pound it, that
 Barney’s managing properly. Let him alone for that.”
 
 “Will _he_ be here to-night?” asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis
 on the pronoun as before.
 
 “Monks, do you mean?” inquired the landlord, hesitating.
 
 “Hush!” said the Jew. “Yes.”
 
 “Certain,” replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; “I
 expected him here before now. If you’ll wait ten minutes, he’ll be—”
 
 “No, no,” said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might
 be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his
 absence. “Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me
 to-night. No, say to-morrow. As he is not here, to-morrow will be time
 enough.”
 
 “Good!” said the man. “Nothing more?”
 
 “Not a word now,” said the Jew, descending the stairs.
 
 “I say,” said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a
 hoarse whisper; “what a time this would be for a sell! I’ve got Phil
 Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!”
 
 “Ah! But it’s not Phil Barker’s time,” said the Jew, looking up. “Phil
 has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go
 back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives—_while
 they last_. Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 The landlord reciprocated the old man’s laugh; and returned to his
 guests. The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its
 former expression of anxiety and thought. After a brief reflection, he
 called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green.
 He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes’s
 residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot.
 
 “Now,” muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, “if there is any
 deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you
 are.”
 
 She was in her room, the woman said. Fagin crept softly upstairs, and
 entered it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying
 with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it.
 
 “She has been drinking,” thought the Jew, cooly, “or perhaps she is
 only miserable.”
 
 The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the
 noise thus occasioned, roused the girl. She eyed his crafty face
 narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit’s story. When
 it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a
 word. She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she
 feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but
 this was all.
 
 During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to
 assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly
 returned. Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or
 thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl
 heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone. At length he made
 another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most
 conciliatory tone,
 
 “And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?”
 
 The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not
 tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be
 crying.
 
 “And the boy, too,” said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse
 of her face. “Poor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!”
 
 “The child,” said the girl, suddenly looking up, “is better where he
 is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies
 dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.”
 
 “What!” cried the Jew, in amazement.
 
 “Ay, I do,” returned the girl, meeting his gaze. “I shall be glad to
 have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. I can’t

26," 
 Margaret Belinda Rysam was the daughter of a New Yorker on the up-grade.
 Her father began to make money when she was a baby and never left off,
 even to take breath, until she was between thirteen and fourteen. Then
 his wife died, not of a broken heart, but of her appetites fed to
 repletion, and an overwhelming desire for further provender. Her poor
 mouth, so much larger than her stomach, was always open. He piled a
 great house on Fifth Avenue into it and a bewilderment of furniture,
 modern old Masters and antiquities, also pearls and other jewellery. She
 never shut it, although later there were a country house to digest and
 some freak entertainments, a multiplicity of reporters and a few
 disappointments. The really “right people” were difficult to secure, the
 nearly “right people” were dust and ashes. A continental tour was to
 follow and a London season.... Before they started she died of a surfeit
 which the doctors called by some other name and operated upon,
 expensively.
 
 In the pause of the hushed house and the funeral Edgar B. Rysam began to
 think that perhaps he had made sufficient money. He really grieved for
 that poor open mouth and those upturned grasping hands, realising that
 it was to overfill them that he had worked. He gave up his office and
 found the days empty, discovered his young daughter, and, nearly to her
 undoing, filled them with her. During her mother’s life she had been
 left to the happy seclusion of nursery or schoolroom; subsidiary to the
 maelstrom of gold-dispensing. Now she had more governesses and tutors
 than could be fitted into the hurrying hours, and became easily aware of
 her importance, that she was the adored and only child of a widowed
 millionaire. Forced into concentrating her entire attention upon herself
 she discovered a remarkable personality. Bent at first on astonishing
 her surroundings she succeeded in astonishing herself. She found that
 she acquired knowledge with infinite ease and had a multiplicity of
 minor talents. She wrote verses and essays, sang, and played on various
 instruments. Highly paid governesses and tutors exclaimed and
 proclaimed. The words prodigy, and genius, pursued and illuminated her.
 At the age of sixteen no subject seemed to her so interesting as the
 consideration of her own psychology.
 
 Nothing could have saved her at this juncture but what actually
 occurred. For she had no incentive to concentration, and every battle
 was won before it was fought. To be was almost sufficient. To do,
 superfluous, almost arrogant.
 
 Edgar B. Rysam had, however, forgotten to safeguard his resources. That
 is to say, his fortune was invested in railroad bonds and stocks. In the
 great railway panic of 1893 prices came tumbling down and public
 confidence fell with them. Edgar B. in alarm, for he had forgotten the
 ways of railway magnates and financiers, sold out and lost half his
 capital. He reopened his office, and by dint of buying and selling at
 the wrong time, rid himself of another quarter. When he woke to his
 position, and retired for the second time, he had only sufficient means
 to be considered a rich man away from his native land. The sale of the
 mansion in Fifth Avenue, the country house, and the yacht damned him in
 the sight of his fellow-citizens. He found himself with a bare fifty
 thousand dollars a year, and no friends. Under the circumstances there
 was nothing for it but emigration, and he finally decided upon England
 as being the most hospitable as well as the most congenial of
 abiding-places. His linguistic attainments consisted of a fair fluency
 in “Americanese.”
 
 During the year he had spent in ruining himself, his young daughter
 became conscious of a pause in the astonished admiration she excited.
 She bore it better than might have been expected, because it
 synchronised with her first love affair. She had become passionately
 enamoured of the “cold white keys” and practised the piano innumerable
 hours in every day.
 
 When Edgar B. remembered her existence again she had grown pale and
 remote, enwrapped in her gift and in her egotism, not doubting at all
 she would be the greatest pianist the world had ever seen, and that all
 those friends and acquaintances who had ignored or cold-shouldered her
 during the last year would wither with self-disdain at not having
 perceived it earlier. Not by her father’s millions would she shine, but
 by reason of her unparalleled powers. The decision to visit Europe and
 settle in England, for a time was not unconnected with these visions.
 She insisted she required more and better lessons. Edgar B. was awed by
 her decision, by her playing, by her astonishingly perverse and burdened
 youth. He was grateful to her for not reproaching him for his failure to
 grapple with a new position, and contrasted her, favourably,
 notwithstanding an uneasy fear of disloyalty, with her mother.
 
 “What do we want of wealth?” she asked in her young scorn. And spoke of
 the vulgarity of money and their scampered friends of the Four Hundred.
 In those early days, when she hoped to become a pianist, she had many of
 the faults of inferior novelists or writers. She used, for instance,
 other people’s words instead of her own, and said she wished to “scorn
 delight and live laborious days.” Edgar B., who knew no vision but money
 against a background of rapacious domestic affection, gaped at and tried
 to understand her. It was not until they were on board the “Minotaur”
 and he had come across an amiable English widow, that he learnt his
 daughter was indeed a genius, ethereal, a wonder-child. But one who
 needed mothering!
 
 Even genius must eat, sleep for reasonable hours, wear warm clothes in
 cold weather. Margaret’s absorbed self-consciousness left her no weapons
 to fight Mrs. Merrill-Cotton’s kindness. She accepted it without
 surprise. It seemed quite natural to her; the only wonder was that the
 whole shipload had eyes or ears for any one else once they had heard her
 play the piano! Mrs. Merrill-Cotton brought her port wine and milk,
 shawls and rugs, volubly admiring her reticence, her unlikeness to other
 girls, her dawning delicate beauty. In truth Margaret at that period was
 girlishly angular and emaciated, from midnight and other labours, too
 much introspection and too little exercise, other than digital. She was
 desultorily interested in her appearance and a little uncertain as to
 whether the mass of her fair hair accorded with her pallid complexion.
 Her eyes were hazel and seemed to her lacking in expression. She did not
 think herself beautiful, but admitted she was “mystic” and of an unusual
 type.
 
 Mrs. Merrill-Cotton found the more appropriate words. “Dawning delicate
 beauty.” They led her to the looking-glass so often that she had no time
 nor thought for what was happening elsewhere. Meanwhile Mrs.
 Merrill-Cotton and Mr. Rysam foregathered on deck, and at mealtimes, at
 the bridge table and in the saloon. Margaret was assured of a stepmother
 long before she realised the possibility of her father having a thought
 for anybody but herself. And then she was told that it was only for her
 sake that the engagement had been entered into! Mrs. Merrill-Cotton, it
 appeared, was the centre of English society, had a large income and a
 larger heart. She, Margaret, would be the chief interest of the two of
 them.
 
 Margaret’s indifference to mundane things was sufficient to make her
 presently accept the position, if not enthusiastically, yet agreeably.
 And, strangely enough, Mrs. Merrill-Cotton proved to be as alleged. She
 had never had a daughter, and wished to mother Margaret: she had no
 other ulterior motive in marrying the American. Her income was at least
 as much as she had said, and she knew a great many people. That they
 were city people of greater wealth than distinction made no difference
 to her future husband. He wanted a domestic hearth and some one to share
 the embarrassment of his exceptional daughter.
 
 The first thing they did after the wedding was to take Margaret to
 Dresden for those piano lessons she craved. She broke down quickly,—had
 not the health, so the doctors said, for her chosen profession. They
 said her heart was weak, and that she was anæmic. So father and
 stepmother brought her back to England, and installed her as the centre
 of interest in the big house in Queen Anne’s Gate.
 
 At eighteen she published her first novel, at her father’s expense. It
 was new in method and tone. Word was sent round by the publisher that
 the authoress was a young and beautiful American heiress, and the result
 was quite an extraordinary little success.
 
 The Lady Mayoress presented her to her Sovereign, after which the social
 atmosphere of the house quickly changed. Margaret began to understand,
 and act. Into the thick coagulated stream of city folk for whom the new
 Mrs. Rysam had an indefinable respect there meandered journalists,
 actors, painters, musicians. The whole tone of the house unconsciously
 but quickly altered. Culture was now the watchword. Money, no longer a
 topic of conversation, was nevertheless permitted to minister to the
 creature comfort of men and women of distinction in art and letters. The
 two elderly people accustomed themselves easily to the change, they were
 of the non-resistant type, and Margaret led them. When in her twentieth
 year her first play was produced at a West End theatre, and she came
 before the curtain to bow her acknowledgment of the applause, their
 pride was overwhelming. The next book was praised by all the critics who
 had been entertained and the journalists who hoped for further
 entertainment. Another and another followed. Open house was kept in
 Queen Anne’s Gate, and there was an idea afloat in lower Bohemia that
 here was the counterpart of the Eighteenth-century salon.
 
 This was the high-water tide of Margaret’s good fortune. She had (as she
 told Gabriel Stanton in one of her letters) everything that a young
 woman could desire. The disposition of wealth, a measure of fame, the
 reputation of beauty, lovers and admirers galore. Why, out of the
 multiplicity of these, she should have selected James Capel, is one of
 those mysteries that always remain inexplicable. It is possible that he
 wooed her perfunctorily, and set her aflame by his comparative
 indifference! She imbued him with diffidence and a hundred chivalrous
 qualities to which he had no claim.
 
 James Capel, at the piano, his head flung back, his dark and too long
 locks flowing, his dark eyes full of slumbrous passions, singing
 mid-Victorian love songs in a voluptuous manner and rich vibrating
 voice, was irresistible to many women, although his lips were thick and
 his nose not classic. A woman like Margaret should have been immune from
 his virus. Alas! she proved ultra-susceptible, and the resultant fever
 exacted from her nearly the extremest penalty.
 
 James Capel accepted all his tributes and seemed to dispense his favours
 equally, kissing this one’s hands and casting languorous glances on the
 others. He made love to Margaret with the rest, knowing no other
 language nor approach. Probably he liked the Rysams’ establishment,
 their big Steinway Grand and the fine dinners, the riot of wealth and
 the unlimited hospitality!
 
 He said afterwards, and every one believed it, all the women at least,
 that the last thing in the world he contemplated was marriage, that the
 whole situation and final elopement were of Margaret’s contriving. Be
 that as it may, one cannot but pity her. She was only twenty, ignorant
 of evil, with the defects of her qualities, emotional, highly strung.
 She contracted a secret marriage with the musician. What she suffered in
 her quick disillusionment can easily be realised. James Capel was
 ill-bred, and of a vanity at least as great as hers. But hers had
 justification and his none.
 
 Margaret may have been inadequate as a wife, she had been used to every
 consideration and found herself without any. James Capel was beneath her
 in everything, in culture and education, refinement. He said openly that
 men like himself were not destined for one woman. Their short married
 life was tragedy, a crucifixion of her young womanhood. She had, with
 all her faults, delicacy, physical reserve, a subtlety of charm and
 brilliant intellect. She had given herself to a man who could appreciate
 none of these, who was coarse from his thick lips to his language, from
 his large spatulate hands to his lascivious small brain. He burned her
 with his taunts of how she had pursued him, torn him from other women,
 forced her love upon him. There was just enough truth in it to make her
 writhe in her desecrated soul and modesties. Of course she thought he
 had feared to aspire. Now he made it evident he considered it was she
 who had aspired!!! He told her of duchesses who had sought his songs and
 his caresses, and gloatingly of unimaginable incidents. He tortured her
 beyond endurance.
 
 She left him for the shelter of her father’s home within a few months of
 their marriage. There she was nursed back into moral and physical
 health, welcomed, comforted, pitied, and she slowly emerged from this
 mud bath of matrimony. Her press, theatrical and lettered friends
 rallied round her; wealth and foreign travel ameliorated the position.
 She wrote again and with greater success than before. Suffering had
 deepened her note, she was still without sentiment, but had acquired
 something of sympathy.
 
 Years passed. She had almost forgotten the degradation and humiliation
 of her marriage, when an escapade of her husband’s, brazenly public,
 forced her to take definite steps for legal freedom. She was now
 sufficiently famous for the papers to treat the news as a _cause
 célèbre_. James Capel unexpectedly defended himself, and fought her with
 every weapon malice and an unscrupulous solicitor could forge. Part of
 the evidence was heard _in camera_, the rest should have been relegated
 to the same obscurity. All the bitterness and misery of those terrible
 months were revived. Now it seemed there was nothing for her but
 obliteration. She thought it impossible she could ever again come before
 the public, for her story to be recalled. She was all unnerved and
 shaken, refusing to go out or to see people. She thought she desired
 nothing but obscurity.
 
 Yet she had to write.
 
 The book on pottery was a sudden inspiration. It would be something
 entirely new and unassociated with her in the public mind. There were
 dreadful months to be got through, the waiting months during which, in
 law at least, she was still James Capel’s wife, a condition more
 intolerable now than it had ever been.
 
 Whatever she may have thought about herself it is obvious that in
 essentials she was unaltered. Her egotism had re-established itself
 under her father and good stepmother’s care, and her amazing
 self-consciousness. To her it seemed as if all the world were talking
 about her. There was some foundation for her belief, of course. In so
 much as she was a public character, she was a favourite of that small
 eclectic public. She may have overrated her position, taken as due to
 herself alone that which was equally if not more essentially owing to
 her father’s wealth and habit of keeping open house. Her letters are
 eminently characteristic. Her self is more prominent in them than her
 lover. She seems to have bewildered Gabriel Stanton, who knew little or
 nothing of women, and carried him off his feet. He may have begun by
 pitying her, she appealed to his pity, to his chivalry. As she said
 herself, she “exposed herself entirely to him.” Young, rich, beautiful,
 famous, she was, nevertheless, at the time she first met Gabriel Stanton
 as a bird in flight, shot on the wing and falling; blood-stained,
 shrinking, terrified, the stain spreading. Into Gabriel Stanton’s
 pitiful powerless hands, set on healing, she fell almost without a
 struggle. This at least is her own phrasing, and the way she wished the
 matter to appear. As it did appear to him, and perhaps sometimes to
 herself. To others of course it might seem she was the fowler, he the
 bird!
 
 Certainly after the first visit to Greyfriars’, when she opened the
 matter of the ill-fated book on Staffordshire Pottery there were
 constant letters, interviews and meetings, conventional and
 unconventional. Perhaps it was only her dramatic brain, working for copy
 behind its enforced and vowed inactivity, that made her act as she did.
 Her letters all read as if they were intended for publication. In her
 disingenuous diary and short MS. notes, there were trial titles, without
 a date, and forced epigrammatic phrases. “Publisher and Sinner” occurred
 once. There is a note that “Between the Nisi and the Absolute” met the
 position more accurately.
 
 She told Gabriel Stanton, she must have convinced Peter Kennedy and
 herself, that she never knew the danger she ran until it was too late.
 But the papers she left disproved the tale.
 
 
 
 
                                CHAPTER IX
 
 
 The early letters have already been transcribed. Also the description of
 when and how I first saw Margaret and Gabriel Stanton together, on the
 beach when she told him that his coming had been a disappointment.
 
 Recalling the swift and painful writing of the story it would seem I saw
 them again two days later, and that she was occupied in making amends.
 They had talked and grown in intimacy, and now it was Sunday evening.
 They were in the music room at Carbies, and she had been playing to him
 while he sat spellbound, listening to and adoring her. She was in that
 grey silk dress with the white muslin fichu finished with a pink rose,
 her pale hair was parted in the middle and she wore her Saint Cecilia
 expression. She left off playing presently, came over to him with swift
 grace and sank on the footstool at his feet.
 
 “What are you thinking about? You are not vexed with me still?”
 
 “Was I ever vexed with you?”
 
 “Yesterday afternoon, when I said I was disappointed in you.”
 
 “Not vexed, surely not vexed, only infinitely grieved, startled.”
 
 “Have you enjoyed your visit, notwithstanding that strange slow
 beginning? Tell me, have you been happy?”
 
 “Have you?”
 
 “I don’t know. I don’t quite know. I have been so excited, restless. I
 have not wanted any one else. It is difficult for me to know myself. Are
 you still sorry for me, like you were in London?”
 
 “My heart goes out to you. You have suffered, but you have great
 compensations; great gifts. I would sympathise with you, but you make me
 feel my own limitations. I fear to fail you. You have the happier
 nature, the wider vision....”
 
 “Then you have not been happy?”
 
 “Yes, I have, inexpressibly happy. I wish I could tell you. But I matter
 so little in comparison with you.”
 
 “I don’t want you to be humble.”
 
 “I am not humble, I am proud.”
 
 “Because?”
 
 “Because you have taken me for your friend.”
 
 He never touched her whilst she sat there at his feet, but his eyes
 never left her and his voice was deep and tender. They talked of
 friendship, all the time, they only spoke of friendship. And he was
 unsure of himself, or of her, more deeply shy than she, and moved,
 though less able to express it.
 
 “Next week you will come again. Will it be the same between us?”
 
 “I will come whenever you let me. With me it will always be the same, or
 more. Sometimes I cannot believe that it is to me this is happening. To
 me, Gabriel Stanton! What is it you find in me? Sometimes I think it is
 only your own sweet goodness; that what you expressed in seeing me this
 time you will find again and again—disappointment; that I am not the man
 you think me, the man you need.”
 
 “Am I what you thought I would be? Are you satisfied with me?”
 
 “I am overpowered with you.”
 
 She stole a look at him. His close and thin-lipped mouth had curves that
 were wholly new, his sunken eyes were lit up. She was secretly
 enraptured with him.
 
 “I thought you very grave and severe when I first came to the office.
 What did you think of me?”
 
 “What I do now, that you were wonderful. After you left I could not
 settle to work ... but I have told you this.”
 
 “Tell me again. Why didn’t you say something nice to me then? You were
 short, sharp, noncommittal. I went away quite downcast, I made sure you
 did not want my poor little book, that you would write and refuse it, in
 set businesslike terms.”
 
 “I knew I would not. If George had said no, I should have fought him. I
 was determined upon that book of Staffordshire Pottery. Were you
 disappointed with my letter when it came?”
 
 “I loved it. I have always loved your letters. You never disappoint me
 then.”
 
 Because they had grown more intimate he was able to say to her gently,
 but with unmistakable feeling:
 
 “Dear, it hurts me so when you say that. I know I shall think of it when
 I am alone, wonder in what way I fail you, how I can alter or change.
 Can you help me, tell me? I came down with such confidence.”
 
 “But you had cut yourself shaving.”
 
 “Be a little serious, beloved. Tell me.”
 
 “You thought I cared for you ... that we should begin in Pineland where
 we left off in London?”
 
 “I hoped....”
 
 “But I had run away from you!”
 
 They smiled at each other.
 
 “You will come again next week?” she asked him inconsistently.
 
 “And if I should again disappoint you?”
 
 “Then you must be patient with me, good to me until it is all right
 again. I am a strange creature, a woman of moods.” She was silent a
 moment. “I have been through so much.” He bent toward her. She rose
 abruptly, there had been little or no caressing between them. Now she
 spoke quickly:
 
 “Don’t hope too much ... or ... or expect anything. I am a megalomaniac:
 everything that happens to me seems larger, grander, finer, more
 wonderful than that which happens to any one else.”
 
 She paused a moment. “This ... then, between us is friendship?” she went
 on tentatively.
 
 He answered her very steadily:
 
 “This, between us, is what you will.”
 
 “You know how it has been with me?” Her voice was broken. He was deeply
 moved and answered:
 
 “God gave it to me to comfort you.”
 
 There was a long pause after that. It was getting late, and they must
 soon part. He kissed her hands when he went away, first one and then the
 other.
 
 “Until next week.”
 
 “Until next week, or any time you need me.”
 
 Then there were letters between them, letters that have already been
 transcribed.
 
 He came the next week and the next. A man of infinite culture, widely
 read and with a very real knowledge of every subject of which he spoke,
 it was not perhaps strange that she fell under the spell of his
 companionship, and found it ever more satisfying.
 
 Her own education was American and superficial, but her intelligence was
 really of a high order and browsed eagerly upon his. The only other she
 was seeing at this time was Dr. Peter Kennedy, a man of very different
 calibre. Peter Kennedy, country born and bred, of a coarsening
 profession and provincial experience.
 
 Margaret was not made to live alone, for all her talk of resources, her
 piano and her books, her writing materials. The house, Carbies, was soon
 obnoxious to her. She had taken it for three months against the advice
 of her people, who feared solitude for her. She could not give in so
 soon, tell them they were right. But it was and remains ugly,
 ill-furnished, with its rough garden. She had some sort of heart attack
 the Monday after Gabriel Stanton’s first visit, and it was then Dr.
 Kennedy told her about her house, wondered at her having taken it.
 
 After he told her that it had been a nursing-home she began to dislike
 the place actively, said the rooms were haunted with the groans of
 people who had been operated upon, that she smelt ether and
 disinfectants. She did not tell Gabriel Stanton these things. To
 Gabriel, Carbies was enchanted ground, he came here as to a shrine,
 worshipping. He used to talk to her of the golden bloom of the gorse,
 and the purple of the distant sea, of the way the sun shone on his
 coming. When with him she made no mention of distaste. For five
 successive weeks that spring the weather held, and each week-end was
 lovelier than the last. From Friday to Monday she may have felt the
 charm of which he spoke. From Monday to Friday she lamented to her
 doctor about the groans and the smell of disinfectants, and he consoled
 her in his own way, which was not hers, and would not have been
 Gabriel’s, but was the best he knew.
 
 Peter Kennedy at this time was recently qualified, not very learned in
 his profession, nor in anything else for that matter. He became quickly
 infatuated with his new patient. She told him she had heart disease, and
 he looked up “Diseases of the Heart” in Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine”
 and gave her all the prescribed remedies, one after another.
 
 He heard of her reputation; chiefly from herself, probably. And that she
 was rich. Mr. and Mrs. Rysam came down once, with motors and maids, and
 made it clear; they told him what a precious charge he had. He took
 Edgar Rysam out golfing, golfing had been Peter Kennedy’s chief interest
 in life until he met Margaret Capel. And Edgar found him very
 companionable and most considerate to a beginner. Edgar Rysam had taken
 to golf because he was putting on flesh, because his London doctor and
 some few stock-broking friends advised it. He had practised assiduously
 with a professional, learnt how to stand, but forgotten the lessons in
 approach and drive and putt.
 
 He had succeeded in acquiring a bag of fine clubs and some golfing
 jargon. He never knew there was any enjoyment in the game until Peter
 Kennedy walked round the Pineland course with him and handicapped him
 into winning a match. After that he wanted to play every day and always,
 talked of prolonging his stay, of coming down again. Margaret reproached
 Peter for what he had done.
 
 “I did it to please you.... I thought you wanted them to be amused.”
 
 “If that was all I wanted I would have stayed in London,” she retorted.
 She was extraordinarily and almost contemptuously straightforward with
 Peter Kennedy. She knew that with a man of his limited experience it was
 unnecessary to be subtle. She may have sometimes encouraged his
 approaches, but the greater part of the time snubbed him unmercifully.
 
 “You don’t put yourself on the same level as Gabriel Stanton, do you?”
 she asked him scornfully one day when he was gloomily complaining that
 “a fellow never had a chance.”
 
 “If I were not more of a man than that I’d kick myself!”
 
 “More of a man!”
 
 “You wouldn’t get _me_ to stay at the hotel.” She flushed and said:
 
 “Well, you can go now. I’ve had enough of you, you tire me.”
 
 “You’ll send for me to come back directly you are ill?”
 
 “Very likely. That only means I like your drugs better than you.”
 
 He seized her hand, her waist, not for the first time, swore that he
 would kill himself if she despised and flouted him. Probably she liked
 the scenes he made her, for she often provoked them. They were mere
 rough animal scenes, acutely different from those she was able to bring
 about with Gabriel. But she did not do the only obvious and correct
 thing, which was to dismiss him and find another doctor.
 
 In these strange days, waiting for her freedom, seeing Gabriel Stanton
",Twilight
27," 
 It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,
 and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
 desk.
 
 “What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”
 
 “I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with
 being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”
 
 “Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”
 
 “So I heard. You have him here?”
 
 “In the cells.”
 
 “Is he quiet?”
 
 “Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”
 
 “Dirty?”
 
 “Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is
 as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he
 will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would
 agree with me that he needed it.”
 
 “I should like to see him very much.”
 
 “Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.”
 
 “No, I think that I’ll take it.”
 
 “Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage,
 opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a
 whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
 
 “The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He
 quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced
 through.
 
 “He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”
 
 We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face
 towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was
 a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a colored
 shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the
 inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his
 face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an
 old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction
 had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were
 exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low
 over his eyes and forehead.
 
 “He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.
 
 “He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he
 might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened
 the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very
 large bath-sponge.
 
 “He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.
 
 “Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
 quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”
 
 “Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look
 a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into
 the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half
 turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes
 stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it
 twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.
 
 “Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,
 in the county of Kent.”
 
 Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off
 under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown
 tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and
 the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A
 twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in
 his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and
 smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes, and staring about him with sleepy
 bewilderment. Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a
 scream, and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
 
 “Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man.
 I know him from the photograph.”
 
 The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself
 to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray, what am I charged with?”
 
 “With making away with Mr. Neville St.—— Oh, come, you can’t be
 charged with that, unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,”
 said the inspector, with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years
 in the force, but this really takes the cake.”
 
 “If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has
 been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”
 
 “No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes.
 “You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”
 
 “It was not the wife, it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God
 help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an
 exposure! What can I do?”
 
 Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly
 on the shoulder.
 
 “If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he,
 “of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you
 convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against
 you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should
 find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,
 make notes upon anything which you might tell us, and submit it to the
 proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”
 
 “God bless you!” cried the prisoner, passionately. “I would have
 endured imprisonment, aye, even execution, rather than have left my
 miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
 
 “You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was
 a school-master in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent
 education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally
 became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor
 wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis,
 and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all
 my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur
 that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an
 actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had
 been famous in the greenroom for my skill. I took advantage now of
 my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as
 possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist
 by the aid of a small slip of flesh-colored plaster. Then with a red
 head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the
 busiest part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller, but really as a
 beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in
 the evening I found, to my surprise, that I had received no less than
 26_s._ 4_d._
 
 “I wrote my articles, and thought little more of the matter until, some
 time later, I backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon
 me for £25. I was at my wits’ end where to get the money, but a sudden
 idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked
 for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the
 city under my disguise. In ten days I had the money, and had paid the
 debt.
 
 “Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
 work at £2 a week, when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by
 smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and
 sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money,
 but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting, and sat day
 after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my
 ghastly face, and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew
 my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in
 Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar,
 and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about
 town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that
 I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.
 
 “Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.
 I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £700
 a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional
 advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of
 repartee, which improved by practice, and made me quite a recognized
 character in the city. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,
 poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take
 £2.
 
 “As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,
 and eventually married, without any one having a suspicion as to my
 real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the city. She
 little knew what.
 
 “Last Monday I had finished for the day, and was dressing in my room
 above the opium den, when I looked out of my window, and saw, to my
 horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with
 her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms
 to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated
 him to prevent any one from coming up to me. I heard her voice
 down-stairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off
 my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and
 wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But
 then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and
 that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening
 by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the
 bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by
 the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag
 in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it
 disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but
 at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few
 minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead
 of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his
 murderer.
 
 “I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was
 determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my
 preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly
 anxious, I slipped off my ring, and confided it to the Lascar at a
 moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried
 scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”
 
 “That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.
 
 “Good God! What a week she must have spent!”
 
 “The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and
 I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter
 unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who
 forgot all about it for some days.”
 
 “That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of
 it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”
 
 “Many times; but what was a fine to me?”
 
 “It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to
 hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”
 
 “I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”
 
 “In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be
 taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,
 Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared
 the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”
 
 “I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and
 consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker
 Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.”
 
 
 
 
 Adventure VII
 
 THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
 
 
 I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning
 after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of
 the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown,
 a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled
 morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch
 was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy
 and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked
 in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the
 chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
 purpose of examination.
 
 “You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”
 
 “Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my
 results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one” (he jerked his thumb in
 the direction of the old hat), “but there are points in connection with
 it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”
 
 I seated myself in his arm-chair and warmed my hands before his
 crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were
 thick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as
 it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is
 the clew which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the
 punishment of some crime.”
 
 “No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of
 those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
 four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of
 a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm
 of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to
 take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may
 be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had
 experience of such.”
 
 “So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have
 added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”
 
 “Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,
 to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of
 the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small
 matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson,
 the commissionaire?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “It is to him that this trophy belongs.”
 
 “It is his hat.”
 
 “No, no; he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look
 upon it, not as a battered billycock, but as an intellectual problem.
 And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,
 in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting
 at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about
 four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a
 very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification, and
 was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him
 he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger,
 and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
 corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a
 little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on
 which he raised his stick to defend himself, and, swinging it over his
 head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward
 to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at
 having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in
 uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and
 vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of
 Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
 Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and
 also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a
 most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”
 
 “Which surely he restored to their owner?”
 
 “My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs.
 Henry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s
 left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible
 upon the lining of this hat; but as there are some thousands of Bakers,
 and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy
 to restore lost property to any one of them.”
 
 “What, then, did Peterson do?”
 
 “He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
 knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The
 goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in
 spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten
 without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to
 fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the
 hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”
 
 “Did he not advertise?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”
 
 “Only as much as we can deduce.”
 
 “From his hat?”
 
 “Precisely.”
 
 “But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”
 
 “Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as
 to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”
 
 I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
 ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,
 hard, and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but
 was a good deal discolored. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes
 had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was
 pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For
 the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several
 places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
 discolored patches by smearing them with ink.
 
 “I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.
 
 “On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to
 reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”
 
 “Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”
 
 He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion
 which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than
 it might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences
 which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a
 strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual
 is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly
 well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon
 evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing
 to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
 fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at
 work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife
 has ceased to love him.”
 
 “My dear Holmes!”
 
 “He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued,
 disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary
 life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,
 has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and
 which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which
 are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely
 improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”
 
 “You are certainly joking, Holmes.”
 
 “Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these
 results, you are unable to see how they are attained?”
 
 “I have no doubt that I am very stupid; but I must confess that I am
 unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was
 intellectual?”
 
 For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the
 forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question
 of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have
 something in it.”
 
 “The decline of his fortunes, then?”
 
 “This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came
 in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of
 ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy
 so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he
 has assuredly gone down in the world.”
 
 “Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and
 the moral retrogression?”
 
 Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he, putting
 his finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat-securer. “They
 are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a
 certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this
 precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the
 elastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he
 has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a
 weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some
 of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a
 sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”
 
 “Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”
 
 “The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,
 that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all
 to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the
 lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by
 the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there
 is a distinct odor of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not
 the gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the
 house, showing that it has been hung up in-doors most of the time;
 while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
 wearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the
 best of training.”
 
 “But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”
 
 “This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
 Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your
 wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also
 have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”
 
 “But he might be a bachelor.”
 
 “Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.
 Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.”
 
 “You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that
 the gas is not laid on in his house?”
 
 “One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I
 see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that
 the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning
 tallow—walks up-stairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and
 a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains
 from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”
 
 “Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said
 just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done, save
 the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew
 open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with
 flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.
 
 “The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.
 
 “Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through
 the kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get
 a fairer view of the man’s excited face.
 
 “See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out
 his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
 scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of
 such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the
 dark hollow of his hand.
 
 Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said he,
 “this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”
 
 “A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were
 putty.”
 
 “It’s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.”
 
 “Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated.
 
 “Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have
 read the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It
 is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the
 reward offered of £1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the
 market price.”
 
 “A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped
 down into a chair, and stared from one to the other of us.
 
 “That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
 sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the
 countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the
 gem.”
 
 “It was lost, if I remember aright, at the ‘Hotel Cosmopolitan,’” I
 remarked.
 
 “Precisely so, on December 22d, just five days ago. John Horner,
 a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s
 jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has
 been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here,
 I believe.” He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,
 until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the
 following paragraph:
 
 “‘Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
 brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22d inst. abstracted from
 the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the
 blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his
 evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room
 of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery, in order that
 he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
 remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called
 away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the
 bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in
 which, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep
 her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly
 gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone
 could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine
 Cusack, maid to the countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of
 dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
 where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector
 Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who
 struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest
 terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given
 against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with
 the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown
 signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the
 conclusion, and was carried out of court.’
 
 “Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes, thoughtfully, tossing
 aside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence
 of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of
 a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our
 little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less
 innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and
 the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat
 and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now
 we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and
 ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do
 this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly
 in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fails, I shall
 have recourse to other methods.”
 
 “What will you say?”
 
 “Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the
 corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker
 can have the same by applying at 6.30 this evening at 221B,
 Baker Street.’ That is clear and concise.”
 
 “Very. But will he see it?”
 
 “Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,
 the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance
 in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson, that he
 thought of nothing but flight; but since then he must have bitterly
 regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again,
 the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for every one
 who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson,
 run down to the advertising agency, and have this put in the evening
 papers.”
 
 “In which, sir?”
 
 “Oh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. James’s_, _Evening
 News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.”
 
 “Very well, sir. And this stone?”
 
 “Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson,
 just buy a goose on your way back, and leave it here with me, for we
 must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your
 family is now devouring.”
 
 When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held
 it against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it
 glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.
 Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and
 older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not
 yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in
 Southern China, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the
 carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade, instead of ruby red. In spite
 of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two
 murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought
 about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.
 Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows
 and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now, and drop a line
 to the countess to say that we have it.”
 
 “Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”
 
 “I cannot tell.”
 
 “Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had
 anything to do with the matter?”
 
 “It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely
 innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was
 of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,
 however, I shall determine by a very simple test, if we have an answer
 to our advertisement.”
 
 “And you can do nothing until then?”
 
 “Nothing.”
 
 “In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come
 back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like
 to see the solution of so tangled a business.”
 
 “Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.
 By-the-way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.
 Hudson to examine its crop.”
 
 I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past
 six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached
 the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was
 buttoned up to his chin, waiting outside in the bright semicircle which
",Holmes
28," “Am I?” cried the girl bitterly. “It’s no fault of yours, if I am not!
 You’d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except
 now;—the humour doesn’t suit you, doesn’t it?”
 
 “No!” rejoined the Jew, furiously. “It does not.”
 
 “Change it, then!” responded the girl, with a laugh.
 
 “Change it!” exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his
 companion’s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, “I
 _will_ change it! Listen to me, you drab. Listen to me, who with six
 words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull’s throat
 between my fingers now. If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind
 him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to
 me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch. And do
 it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too
 late!”
 
 “What is all this?” cried the girl involuntarily.
 
 “What is it?” pursued Fagin, mad with rage. “When the boy’s worth
 hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way
 of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could
 whistle away the lives of! And me bound, too, to a born devil that only
 wants the will, and has the power to, to—”
 
 Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that
 instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole
 demeanour. A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his
 eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he
 shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the
 apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy. After a
 short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion. He appeared
 somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from
 which he had first roused her.
 
 “Nancy, dear!” croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. “Did you mind me,
 dear?”
 
 “Don’t worry me now, Fagin!” replied the girl, raising her head
 languidly. “If Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has
 done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and
 when he can’t he won’t; so no more about that.”
 
 “Regarding this boy, my dear?” said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his
 hands nervously together.
 
 “The boy must take his chance with the rest,” interrupted Nancy,
 hastily; “and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm’s way,
 and out of yours,—that is, if Bill comes to no harm. And if Toby got
 clear off, Bill’s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill’s worth two of Toby
 any time.”
 
 “And about what I was saying, my dear?” observed the Jew, keeping his
 glistening eye steadily upon her.
 
 “You must say it all over again, if it’s anything you want me to do,”
 rejoined Nancy; “and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow. You
 put me up for a minute; but now I’m stupid again.”
 
 Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of
 ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but,
 she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his
 searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a
 trifle in liquor, was confirmed. Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a
 failing which was very common among the Jew’s female pupils; and in
 which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than
 checked. Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva
 which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of
 the justice of the Jew’s supposition; and when, after indulging in the
 temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into
 dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the
 influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave
 utterance to various exclamations of “Never say die!” and divers
 calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a
 lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable
 experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction,
 that she was very far gone indeed.
 
 Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his
 twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard,
 and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned,
 Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend
 asleep, with her head upon the table.
 
 It was within an hour of midnight. The weather being dark, and piercing
 cold, he had no great temptation to loiter. The sharp wind that scoured
 the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and
 mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance
 hastening fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the Jew,
 however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as
 every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.
 
 He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling
 in his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a
 projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road,
 glided up to him unperceived.
 
 “Fagin!” whispered a voice close to his ear.
 
 “Ah!” said the Jew, turning quickly round, “is that—”
 
 “Yes!” interrupted the stranger. “I have been lingering here these two
 hours. Where the devil have you been?”
 
 “On your business, my dear,” replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his
 companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. “On your business all
 night.”
 
 “Oh, of course!” said the stranger, with a sneer. “Well; and what’s
 come of it?”
 
 “Nothing good,” said the Jew.
 
 “Nothing bad, I hope?” said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a
 startled look on his companion.
 
 The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger,
 interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this
 time arrived: remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say,
 under cover: for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and
 the wind blew through him.
 
 Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking
 home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered
 something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request
 in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to
 close it softly, while he got a light.
 
 “It’s as dark as the grave,” said the man, groping forward a few steps.
 “Make haste!”
 
 “Shut the door,” whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he
 spoke, it closed with a loud noise.
 
 “That wasn’t my doing,” said the other man, feeling his way. “The wind
 blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp
 with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in
 this confounded hole.”
 
 Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. After a short absence,
 he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby
 Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in
 the front one. Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way
 upstairs.
 
 “We can say the few words we’ve got to say in here, my dear,” said the
 Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; “and as there are holes
 in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we’ll set
 the candle on the stairs. There!”
 
 With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper
 flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. This done, he led
 the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a
 broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which
 stood behind the door. Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat
 himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the
 arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face. It was not quite dark; the
 door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble
 reflection on the opposite wall.
 
 They conversed for some time in whispers. Though nothing of the
 conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and
 there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be
 defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the
 latter was in a state of considerable irritation. They might have been
 talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks—by which
 name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course
 of their colloquy—said, raising his voice a little,
 
 “I tell you again, it was badly planned. Why not have kept him here
 among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at
 once?”
 
 “Only hear him!” exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.
 
 “Why, do you mean to say you couldn’t have done it, if you had chosen?”
 demanded Monks, sternly. “Haven’t you done it, with other boys, scores
 of times? If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn’t
 you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps
 for life?”
 
 “Whose turn would that have served, my dear?” inquired the Jew humbly.
 
 “Mine,” replied Monks.
 
 “But not mine,” said the Jew, submissively. “He might have become of
 use to me. When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only
 reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my
 good friend?”
 
 “What then?” demanded Monks.
 
 “I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,” replied the Jew;
 “he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.”
 
 “Curse him, no!” muttered the man, “or he would have been a thief, long
 ago.”
 
 “I had no hold upon him to make him worse,” pursued the Jew, anxiously
 watching the countenance of his companion. “His hand was not in. I had
 nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the
 beginning, or we labour in vain. What could I do? Send him out with the
 Dodger and Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I
 trembled for us all.”
 
 “_That_ was not my doing,” observed Monks.
 
 “No, no, my dear!” renewed the Jew. “And I don’t quarrel with it now;
 because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on
 the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you
 were looking for. Well! I got him back for you by means of the girl;
 and then _she_ begins to favour him.”
 
 “Throttle the girl!” said Monks, impatiently.
 
 “Why, we can’t afford to do that just now, my dear,” replied the Jew,
 smiling; “and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one
 of these days, I might be glad to have it done. I know what these girls
 are, Monks, well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she’ll care no
 more for him, than for a block of wood. You want him made a thief. If
 he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if—if—” said the
 Jew, drawing nearer to the other,—“it’s not likely, mind,—but if the
 worst comes to the worst, and he is dead—”
 
 “It’s no fault of mine if he is!” interposed the other man, with a look
 of terror, and clasping the Jew’s arm with trembling hands. “Mind that.
 Fagin! I had no hand in it. Anything but his death, I told you from the
 first. I won’t shed blood; it’s always found out, and haunts a man
 besides. If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me?
 Fire this infernal den! What’s that?”
 
 “What!” cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both
 arms, as he sprung to his feet. “Where?”
 
 “Yonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. “The shadow! I
 saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the
 wainscot like a breath!”
 
 The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room.
 The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been
 placed. It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white
 faces. They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout
 the house.
 
 “It’s your fancy,” said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his
 companion.
 
 “I’ll swear I saw it!” replied Monks, trembling. “It was bending
 forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.”
 
 The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and,
 telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs. They
 looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty. They
 descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below. The
 green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug
 glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.
 
 “What do you think now?” said the Jew, when they had regained the
 passage. “Besides ourselves, there’s not a creature in the house except
 Toby and the boys; and they’re safe enough. See here!”
 
 As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket;
 and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them
 in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.
 
 This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His
 protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they
 proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he
 gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have
 been his excited imagination. He declined any renewal of the
 conversation, however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was
 past one o’clock. And so the amiable couple parted.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXVII.
 ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY,
 MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY
 
 
 As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so
 mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and
 the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as
 it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less
 become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a
 lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and
 affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming
 from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of
 whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words—trusting
 that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence
 for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is
 delegated—hastens to pay them that respect which their position
 demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their
 exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at
 his hands. Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in
 this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and
 elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could
 not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the
 right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of
 time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting
 opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that
 a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle,
 attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official
 capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office,
 possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and
 that to none of those excellences, can mere companies’ beadles, or
 court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last,
 and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest
 sustainable claim.
 
 Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs,
 made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety
 the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats
 of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times;
 before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.
 Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney’s
 approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and
 virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his
 curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney’s chest
 of drawers.
 
 Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was
 approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded
 to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers:
 which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture,
 carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with
 dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction. Arriving,
 in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the
 key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken,
 gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble
 returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old
 attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, “I’ll do it!” He
 followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a
 waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with
 himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his
 legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.
 
 He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney,
 hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a
 chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the
 other over her heart, and gasped for breath.
 
 “Mrs. Corney,” said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, “what is
 this, ma’am? Has anything happened, ma’am? Pray answer me: I’m on—on—”
 Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word
 “tenterhooks,” so he said “broken bottles.”
 
 “Oh, Mr. Bumble!” cried the lady, “I have been so dreadfully put out!”
 
 “Put out, ma’am!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble; “who has dared to—? I know!”
 said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, “this is them
 wicious paupers!”
 
 “It’s dreadful to think of!” said the lady, shuddering.
 
 “Then _don’t_ think of it, ma’am,” rejoined Mr. Bumble.
 
 “I can’t help it,” whimpered the lady.
 
 “Then take something, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble soothingly. “A little of
 the wine?”
 
 “Not for the world!” replied Mrs. Corney. “I couldn’t,—oh! The top
 shelf in the right-hand corner—oh!” Uttering these words, the good lady
 pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from
 internal spasms. Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint
 green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a
 tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady’s lips.
 
 “I’m better now,” said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half
 of it.
 
 Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,
 bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.
 
 “Peppermint,” exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently
 on the beadle as she spoke. “Try it! There’s a little—a little
 something else in it.”
 
 Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips;
 took another taste; and put the cup down empty.
 
 “It’s very comforting,” said Mrs. Corney.
 
 “Very much so indeed, ma’am,” said the beadle. As he spoke, he drew a
 chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to
 distress her.
 
 “Nothing,” replied Mrs. Corney. “I am a foolish, excitable, weak
 creetur.”
 
 “Not weak, ma’am,” retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little
 closer. “Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?”
 
 “We are all weak creeturs,” said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general
 principle.
 
 “So we are,” said the beadle.
 
 Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the
 expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by
 removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney’s chair, where it
 had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney’s apron-string, round which it
 gradually became entwined.
 
 “We are all weak creeturs,” said Mr. Bumble.
 
 Mrs. Corney sighed.
 
 “Don’t sigh, Mrs. Corney,” said Mr. Bumble.
 
 “I can’t help it,” said Mrs. Corney. And she sighed again.
 
 “This is a very comfortable room, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble looking
 round. “Another room, and this, ma’am, would be a complete thing.”
 
 “It would be too much for one,” murmured the lady.
 
 “But not for two, ma’am,” rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. “Eh,
 Mrs. Corney?”
 
 Mrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle
 drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney’s face. Mrs. Corney, with
 great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at
 her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr.
 Bumble.
 
 “The board allows you coals, don’t they, Mrs. Corney?” inquired the
 beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.
 
 “And candles,” replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.
 
 “Coals, candles, and house-rent free,” said Mr. Bumble. “Oh, Mrs.
 Corney, what an Angel you are!”
 
 The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling. She sank into Mr.
 Bumble’s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a
 passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.
 
 “Such porochial perfection!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. “You
 know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?”
 
 “Yes,” replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.
 
 “He can’t live a week, the doctor says,” pursued Mr. Bumble. “He is the
 master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that
 wacancy must be filled up. Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens!
 What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!”
 
 Mrs. Corney sobbed.
 
 “The little word?” said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty.
 “The one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?”
 
 “Ye—ye—yes!” sighed out the matron.
 
 “One more,” pursued the beadle; “compose your darling feelings for only
 one more. When is it to come off?”
 
 Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed. At length
 summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble’s neck, and
 said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was “a
 irresistible duck.”
 
 Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract
 was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture;
 which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of
 the lady’s spirits. While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr.
 Bumble with the old woman’s decease.
 
 “Very good,” said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; “I’ll call at
 Sowerberry’s as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning. Was
 it that as frightened you, love?”
 
 “It wasn’t anything particular, dear,” said the lady evasively.
 
 “It must have been something, love,” urged Mr. Bumble. “Won’t you tell
 your own B.?”
 
 “Not now,” rejoined the lady; “one of these days. After we’re married,
 dear.”
 
 “After we’re married!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble. “It wasn’t any impudence
 from any of them male paupers as—”
 
 “No, no, love!” interposed the lady, hastily.
 
 “If I thought it was,” continued Mr. Bumble; “if I thought as any one
 of ’em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance—”
 
 “They wouldn’t have dared to do it, love,” responded the lady.
 
 “They had better not!” said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. “Let me see
 any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I
 can tell him that he wouldn’t do it a second time!”
 
 Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed
 no very high compliment to the lady’s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble
 accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched
 with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration,
 that he was indeed a dove.
 
 The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat;
 and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future
 partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing,
 for a few minutes, in the male paupers’ ward, to abuse them a little,
 with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of
 workhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications,
 Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of
 his future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached
 the shop of the undertaker.
 
 Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and
 Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a
 greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient
 performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was
 not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up. Mr.
 Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but,
 attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the
 glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made
 bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what
 was going forward, he was not a little surprised.
 
 The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and
 butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the
 upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an
 easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open
 clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other.
 Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which
 Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity. A more
 than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman’s nose, and
 a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight
 degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish
 with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong
 appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever,
 could have sufficiently accounted.
 
 “Here’s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!” said Charlotte; “try him, do;
 only this one.”
 
 “What a delicious thing is a oyster!” remarked Mr. Claypole, after he
 had swallowed it. “What a pity it is, a number of ’em should ever make
 you feel uncomfortable; isn’t it, Charlotte?”
 
 “It’s quite a cruelty,” said Charlotte.
 
 “So it is,” acquiesced Mr. Claypole. “An’t yer fond of oysters?”
 
 “Not overmuch,” replied Charlotte. “I like to see you eat ’em, Noah
 dear, better than eating ’em myself.”
 
 “Lor!” said Noah, reflectively; “how queer!”
 
 “Have another,” said Charlotte. “Here’s one with such a beautiful,
 delicate beard!”
 
 “I can’t manage any more,” said Noah. “I’m very sorry. Come here,
 Charlotte, and I’ll kiss yer.”
 
 “What!” said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. “Say that again, sir.”
 
 Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron. Mr.
 Claypole, without making any further change in his position than
 suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken
 terror.
 
 “Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!” said Mr. Bumble. “How dare
 you mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him, you
 insolent minx? Kiss her!” exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.
 “Faugh!”
 
 “I didn’t mean to do it!” said Noah, blubbering. “She’s always
 a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.”
 
 “Oh, Noah,” cried Charlotte, reproachfully.
 
 “Yer are; yer know yer are!” retorted Noah. “She’s always a-doin’ of
 it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and
 makes all manner of love!”
 
 “Silence!” cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. “Take yourself downstairs, ma’am.
 Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes
 home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr.
 Bumble said he was to send a old woman’s shell after breakfast
 to-morrow morning. Do you hear sir? Kissing!” cried Mr. Bumble, holding
 up his hands. “The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this
 porochial district is frightful! If Parliament don’t take their
 abominable courses under consideration, this country’s ruined, and the
 character of the peasantry gone for ever!” With these words, the beadle
 strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker’s premises.
 
 And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have
 made all necessary preparations for the old woman’s funeral, let us set
 on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether
 he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXVIII.
 LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES
 
 
 “Wolves tear your throats!” muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth. “I wish
 I was among some of you; you’d howl the hoarser for it.”
 
 As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate
 ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body
 of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an
 instant, to look back at his pursuers.
 
 There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud
 shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the
 neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in
 every direction.
 
 “Stop, you white-livered hound!” cried the robber, shouting after Toby
 Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead.
 “Stop!”
 
 The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. For he
 was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot;
 and Sikes was in no mood to be played with.
 
 “Bear a hand with the boy,” cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his
 confederate. “Come back!”
 
 Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for
 want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly
 along.
 
 “Quicker!” cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and
 drawing a pistol from his pocket. “Don’t play booty with me.”
 
 At this moment the noise grew louder. Sikes, again looking round, could
 discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate
 of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some
 paces in advance of them.
 
 “It’s all up, Bill!” cried Toby; “drop the kid, and show ’em your
 heels.” With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of
 being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his
 enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed. Sikes
 clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form
 of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along
 the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those
 behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before
 another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol
 high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.
 
 “Ho, ho, there!” cried a tremulous voice in the rear. “Pincher!
 Neptune! Come here, come here!”
 
 The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no
 particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily
 answered to the command. Three men, who had by this time advanced some
 distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.
 
 “My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,” said the
 fattest man of the party, “that we ’mediately go home again.”
 
 “I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,” said a
 shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very
 pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.
 
 “I shouldn’t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,” said the third,
 who had called the dogs back, “Mr. Giles ought to know.”
 
 “Certainly,” replied the shorter man; “and whatever Mr. Giles says, it
 isn’t our place to contradict him. No, no, I know my sitiwation! Thank
 my stars, I know my sitiwation.” To tell the truth, the little man
 _did_ seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it
 was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as
 he spoke.
 
 “You are afraid, Brittles,” said Mr. Giles.
 
 “I an’t,” said Brittles.
 
 “You are,” said Giles.
 
 “You’re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,” said Brittles.
 
 “You’re a lie, Brittles,” said Mr. Giles.
 
 Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles’s taunt; and Mr. Giles’s
 taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of
 going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment. The
 third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.
 
 “I’ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,” said he, “we’re all afraid.”
 
 “Speak for yourself, sir,” said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the
 party.
 
 “So I do,” replied the man. “It’s natural and proper to be afraid,
 under such circumstances. I am.”
 
 “So am I,” said Brittles; “only there’s no call to tell a man he is, so
 bounceably.”
 
 These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that _he_
 was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again
 with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest
 wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely
 insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.
 
 “But it’s wonderful,” said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, “what a
 man will do, when his blood is up. I should have committed murder—I
 know I should—if we’d caught one of them rascals.”
 
 As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as
 their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued
 upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.
 
 “I know what it was,” said Mr. Giles; “it was the gate.”
 
 “I shouldn’t wonder if it was,” exclaimed Brittles, catching at the
 idea.
 
 “You may depend upon it,” said Giles, “that that gate stopped the flow
 of the excitement. I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was
 climbing over it.”
 
 By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the
 same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment. It was quite obvious,
 therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt
 regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all
 three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the
 instant of its occurance.
 
 This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the
 burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse,
 and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in
 the pursuit. Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and
 steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work:
 who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a
 promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty.
 
 Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very
 close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round,
 whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried
 back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its
 light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire. Catching up
 the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot;
 and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the
 light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like
 some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was
 swiftly borne.
 
 The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along
 the ground like a dense cloud of smoke. The grass was wet; the
 pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of
 an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning. Still,
 Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left
 him.
 
 Morning drew on apace. The air become more sharp and piercing, as its
 first dull hue—the death of night, rather than the birth of
 day—glimmered faintly in the sky. The objects which had looked dim and
 terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually
 resolved into their familiar shapes. The rain came down, thick and
 fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes. But, Oliver felt
 it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless
 and unconscious, on his bed of clay.
 
 At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and
 uttering it, the boy awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl,
 hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with
 blood. He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a
 sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help,
 and groaned with pain. Trembling in every joint, from cold and
 exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from
 head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.
 
 After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long
 plunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which
 seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon
 his feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to
 and fro like a drunken man. But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his
 head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew
 not whither.
 
 And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his
 mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were
 angrily disputing—for the very words they said, sounded in his ears;
 and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some
 violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was
 talking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the
 previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber’s
 grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of
 firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights
 gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand
 bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an
 undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented
 him incessantly.
 
 Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars
 of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he
 reached a road. Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused
 him.
 
 He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house,
 which perhaps he could reach. Pitying his condition, they might have
 compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought,
 to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields. He summoned
 up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps
 towards it.
 
 As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had
 seen it before. He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and
 aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.
 
 That garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last
 night, and prayed the two men’s mercy. It was the very house they had
 attempted to rob.
 
 Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that,
 for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of
 flight. Flight! He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full
 possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame,
 whither could he fly? He pushed against the garden-gate; it was
 unlocked, and swung open on its hinges. He tottered across the lawn;
 climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength
 failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little
 portico.
 
 It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker,
 were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the
 night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it was Mr.
 Giles’s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants:
 towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty
 affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of
 his superior position in society. But, death, fires, and burglary, make
 all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the
 kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his
 right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the
 robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid,
 who were of the party) listened with breathless interest.
 
 “It was about half-past two,” said Mr. Giles, “or I wouldn’t swear that
 it mightn’t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and,
 turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned
 round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him
 to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.”
 
 At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the
 housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker,
 who pretended not to hear.
 
 “—Heerd a noise,” continued Mr. Giles. “I says, at first, ‘This is
 illusion’; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the
 noise again, distinct.”
 
 “What sort of a noise?” asked the cook.
 
 “A kind of a busting noise,” replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.
 
 “More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,”
 suggested Brittles.
 
 “It was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,” rejoined Mr. Giles; “but, at this
 time, it had a busting sound. I turned down the clothes”; continued
 Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, “sat up in bed; and listened.”
 
 The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated “Lor!” and drew their
 chairs closer together.
 
 “I heerd it now, quite apparent,” resumed Mr. Giles. “‘Somebody,’ I
 says, ‘is forcing of a door, or window; what’s to be done? I’ll call up
 that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed;
 or his throat,’ I says, ‘may be cut from his right ear to his left,
 without his ever knowing it.’”
 
 Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the
 speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face
 expressive of the most unmitigated horror.
 
 “I tossed off the clothes,” said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth,
 and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, “got softly out of
 bed; drew on a pair of—”
 
 “Ladies present, Mr. Giles,” murmured the tinker.
 
 “—Of _shoes_, sir,” said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great
 emphasis on the word; “seized the loaded pistol that always goes
 upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.
 ‘Brittles,’ I says, when I had woke him, ‘don’t be frightened!’”
 
 “So you did,” observed Brittles, in a low voice.
 
 “‘We’re dead men, I think, Brittles,’ I says,” continued Giles; “‘but
 don’t be frightened.’”
 
 “_Was_ he frightened?” asked the cook.
 
 “Not a bit of it,” replied Mr. Giles. “He was as firm—ah! pretty near
 as firm as I was.”
 
 “I should have died at once, I’m sure, if it had been me,” observed the
 housemaid.
 
 “You’re a woman,” retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.
 
 “Brittles is right,” said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly;
 “from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a
 dark lantern that was standing on Brittle’s hob, and groped our way
 downstairs in the pitch dark,—as it might be so.”
 
 Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes
 shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he
 started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried
 back to his chair. The cook and housemaid screamed.
 
 “It was a knock,” said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. “Open the
 door, somebody.”
 
 Nobody moved.
 
 “It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in
 the morning,” said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded
 him, and looking very blank himself; “but the door must be opened. Do
 you hear, somebody?”
 
 Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being
 naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that
 the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he
 tendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the
 tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep. The women were out of the
 question.
 
 “If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,”
 said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, “I am ready to make one.”
 
 “So am I,” said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen
 asleep.
 
 Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat
 re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that
 it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.
 The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear. By
 the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any
 evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by
 a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same
 ingenious gentleman, the dogs’ tails were well pinched, in the hall, to
 make them bark savagely.
 
 These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the
 tinker’s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and
 gave the word of command to open the door. Brittles obeyed; the group,
 peeping timorously over each other’s shoulders, beheld no more
 formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and
",OliverTwist
29," He himself suggested more than once that she should have other advice
 about her heart and he brought his partner to see her. But never
 repeated the experiment. Dr. Lansdowne purred and prodded her, talking
 all the time he used his stethoscope, smiling between whiles in a
 superior way as if he knew everything. Particularly when she tried to
 tell him her symptoms, or what other doctors had diagnosed.
 
 “You have a nurse?” he asked her. “I had better see her nurse, Kennedy.”
 
 “A nurse,—why should I have a nurse? I have a maid.”
 
 “You ought never to be without a nurse. You ought never to be alone,” he
 told her solemnly. “Now do, my dear child, be guided by me.” He smiled
 and patted her. “I will tell Dr. Kennedy all about it, give him full
 instructions. I will see you again in a few days. Come, Kennedy, I can
 give you a lift; we will decide what is to be done.” He smiled his
 farewell.
 
 “See me again in a day or two! Not if I know it. Not in a day or two, or
 a week or two, or a month or two.”
 
 She was furious with him, and with Dr. Kennedy for having brought him.
 Peter Kennedy had acted well, according to his lights. He did not wish
 to turn his beloved patient over to his all-conquering partner, but the
 more infatuated he became about her the less he trusted his own
 knowledge.
 
 “A bad case of angina, extensive valvular disease. Keep her as quiet as
 possible, she ought not to be contradicted. Get a nurse or a couple of
 nurses for her. Daughter of Edgar Rysam, the American millionaire, isn’t
 she? Seems to have taken quite a fancy to you. Extraordinary creatures
 these so-called clever women! You ought to make a good thing out of the
 case.”
 
 Kennedy went back to Carbies after Dr. Lansdowne dropped him, made his
 way back as quickly as possible. Margaret had bidden him return to tell
 her what had been said.
 
 “Not that I believe in him or in anything he may have told you. He did
 not even listen to my heart, he was so busy talking and grinning and
 reassuring me. What did he tell you? That he heard a murmur? I am so
 sick of that murmur. I have been hearing of it ever since I was a
 child.”
 
 Peter slurred over everything Lansdowne had said to him, except that she
 must be kept quiet; she must not allow herself to get excited. He
 implored her to keep very quiet. She laughed and asked whether he
 thought he had a calmative influence? He put his arms about her for all
 that she resisted him and blubbered over her like the great baby he was.
 
 “I adore you, I want to take care of you, and you won’t look at anybody
 but him.”
 
 She pushed him away, told him she could not bear to be touched.
 
 “If it hadn’t been for him? Tell me, if it hadn’t been for Gabriel
 Stanton it would have been me, wouldn’t it? You do like me a little,
 don’t you?”
 
 It was impossible to keep him at a proper distance.
 
 “Like you! not particularly. Why should I? You are very troublesome and
 presumptuous.”
 
 She could not deal with him as she did with Gabriel. To this young
 country doctor, ten years before I knew him and he had acquired wisdom,
 men and women were just men and women, no more and no less. He had
 fallen headlong in love with Margaret, and when he saw he had, as he
 said, no chance, he could not be brought to believe that Gabriel Stanton
 was not her lover. He was demonstratively primitive, and many of his
 so-called medical visits she spent in fighting his advances. He knew
 that what she had to give she was giving to Gabriel Stanton, because she
 told him so, made no secret of it, but was for ever asking “If it hadn’t
 been for him? If you’d met me first?” One would have thought that
 Margaret, Gabriel’s “fair pale Margaret,” would have resented or at
 least tired of this rough persistent wooing, but if this were so there
 was nothing in her conduct to show it.
 
 She said or wrote to Gabriel Stanton: “the very thought of physical love
 is repugnant to me, horrible.” Yet Peter kissed her hands, her feet,
 attempted her lips, made her fierce wild scenes. She called him a boy,
 but he was a year older than herself. Gabriel brought her books and the
 most reverent worship, was mindful of her slightest wish. He hoped that
 one day she would be his wife, but scarcely dared to say it, since once
 she put the matter aside, almost imploringly, growing pale, seeming
 afraid.
 
 “Don’t talk to me of marriage, not yet. How can you? At least, wait!”
 
 She spoke of her sensitiveness. But her sensitiveness was as a mountain
 to a mist compared with his.
 
 She would tell him her most intimate thoughts, sit with him by dying
 fire or in gathering twilight, holding herself aloof. If, because he was
 so different from Peter Kennedy, she did sometimes try her woman’s wiles
 on him, she never moved him to depart from the programme or the
 principles she herself had laid down.
 
 Another Sunday evening,—it was either the third or fourth of his
 coming,—sitting in the lamplight, after dinner, in the music room, after
 a long enervating day of mutual confidences and ever-growing intimacy,
 she tried to break through his defences. They had been talking of
 Nietzsche, not of his philosophy, but his life. She had been envying
 Nietzsche’s devoted sister and her opportunities when, suddenly and
 disingenuously, she startled Gabriel by saying:
 
 “You are not a bit interested in what I am saying, you are thinking of
 something else all the time.”
 
 “Of you ... only of you!”
 
 “Of the intellectual me or the physical me? Do I please you tonight?”
 
 She nearly always wore grey, a ribbon or a flower, material or cut,
 diversified her wardrobe. Tonight the grey material was the softest
 crêpe de chine; and she wore one pink rose in a blue belt. This
 treatment gave value to her _blonde cendré_ hair and fair complexion,
 she gave the impression of a most delicate, slightly faded, yet modern
 miniature.
 
 “You always please me.”
 
 “Please, or excite you?”
 
 “My dear one!”
 
 He was startled, thought she did not know what it was she was saying.
 His blood leaped, but he had it under control. What was growing
 perfectly between them was love. She would soon be a free woman.
 
 “I want to know. Sometimes I wonder if I were more beautiful....”
 
 “You could not be more beautiful.”
 
 “More like other women, or perhaps if you were more like other men....”
 
 “There is no difference between me and other men,” he answered quickly.
 And then although he thought she did not know what she was implying, or
 where the conversation might carry them, he went on even more steadily:
 “I want to carry out your wishes. If I had the privilege of telling you
 all that is in my heart....”
 
 “I am admiring your self-control.”
 
 It was true she hardly knew what was impelling her to this reckless
 mood. “My wishes! What are my wishes? Sometimes one thing and sometimes
 another. Tonight for instance....”
 
 He was in the corner of the sofa, she on the high fender stool in the
 firelight. There were only oil lamps in the room, and she and the
 fireside shone more brightly than they.
 
 When she said softly, “Tonight for instance,” she got up; her eyes
 seemed to challenge him. He rose too, and would have taken her in his
 arms, but that she resisted.
 
 “No, no, no, you don’t really want to ... talking is enough for you.”
 
 “You strange Margaret,” he said tenderly.
 
 “I sometimes wonder if you care for me or only for my talk,” she said
 with a nervous laugh.
 
 “If you only knew.” His arms remained about her.
 
 “If I only knew!” she exclaimed. “Tell me,” she whispered coaxingly.
 
 “How I long for this waiting time to be at an end. To woo you, win you.
 You say anything approaching physical love is hateful and abhorrent to
 you. Yet, if I thought ... Margaret!”
 
 She did not repel him, although his arms were around her. And now,
 reverently, softly, he sought and found her unreluctant lips. One of the
 lamps flickered and went out. His arms tightened about her; she had not
 thought to be so happy in any man’s arms. Her heart beat very fast and
 the blood in her pulses rose.
 
 “How much do you care for me?” she whispered; her voice trembled.
 
 “More than for life itself,” he whispered back.
 
 “And I ... I....” He felt her trembling in his arms as if with fear. He
 loved and hushed her with ineffable tenderness, his control keeping pace
 with his rising blood. “My love, my love, I will take care of you. Trust
 yourself to me. I love you perfectly, beloved.”
 
 He had an exquisite sense of honour and a complete ignorance of
 womanhood. A flash of electricity from him and all would have been
 aflame. But she had said once that until the decree was made absolute
 she did not look upon herself as a free woman.
 
 “My little brave one, beloved. _It will not be always like this between
 us._ Tell me that it will not. I count the days and hours. You will take
 me for your husband?”
 
 She could feel the beating of his pulses, her cheek lay against his
 coat. But her heart slowed down a little. How steadfast he was and
 reliable, the soul of honour. But she was a woman, difficult to satisfy.
 She had wanted from him this evening, this moment, something of that she
 won so easily from Peter Kennedy. The temperament she denied was alight
 and clamorous.
 
 “Gabriel.”
 
 “Heart of my innermost heart.”
 
 “I am so lonely in this house.”
 
 “Sweetheart.”
 
 “So lonely; it is haunted, I think. I can never sleep, I lie awake ...
 for hours. _Don’t go._”
 
 Her own words shook and shocked her. She was still and supine in his
 encompassing arm. There was perhaps a relaxation of his moral fineness,
 a faint disintegration. But of only a moment’s duration, and no man ever
 held a woman more reverently or more tenderly.
 
 “My wife that will be ... that will be soon. How I adore you.”
 
 Their hands were interlocked, they felt the dear sweetness of each
 other’s breath; their hearts were beating fast.
 
 Silence then, a long-drawn silence.
 
 “It is not long now. I am counting the days, the hours. You won’t say
 again I disappoint you, will you? You will bear with me?”
 
 She clung closer to him. Tonight he moved her strangely.
 
 “You really do love me?” she whispered.
 
 “I want to take care of you always. My dear, darling, how good you are
 to let me love you! One day I will be your husband! I dare hardly say
 the words. Promise me!” And again his lips sought hers. “Your husband
 and your lover....”
 
 An extraordinary chill came upon her. She could not herself say what had
 happened, the effect, but never the cause.
 
 She disengaged herself from him. When he saw she wanted to go he made no
 effort to hold her.
 
 “It is very late, isn’t it?” He made no answer, and she repeated the
 question. “It’s very late, isn’t it?”
 
 “I don’t know.”
 
 “I wish you would look.”
 
 He took out his watch.
 
 “Barely ten. You are tired?”
 
 “Yes, a little.”
 
 “Margaret, you say you are lonely in this house, nervous. Would you feel
 better if I patrolled the garden, if you felt I was at hand?”
 
 “Oh, no, no. I didn’t know what I was saying.”
 
 All her mood had changed.
 
 “I must have forgotten Stevens and the other maids.”
 
 Then she moved away from him, over to the round table where the dead
 lamp still gave an occasional flicker.
 
 She tried it this way and that, but there was no flame, only flicker.
 
 “You always take me so seriously, misunderstand me.”
 
 He came near her again.
 
 “I don’t think I misunderstand you,” he said tenderly.
 
 “I am sorry,” she answered vaguely. “It was my fault.”
 
 “Fault! You have not a fault!”
 
 “But now—I want you to go.”
 
 His eyes questioned and caressed her.
 
 “Until next week then.”
 
 He took her in his arms, but her lips were cold, unresponsive, it was
 almost an apology she made:
 
 “I am really so tired.”
 
 When he had gone, lying among the pillows on the sofa, she said to
 herself:
 
 “Greek roots! He is supposed to be more learned in Greek roots than any
 one in England. But the root word of this he missed entirely. REACTION.
 That is the root word. I don’t know what came over me. Why is he so
 unlike other men? What if such a moment had come to me with Peter
 Kennedy!”
 
 She smiled faintly all by herself in the firelight. How impossible it
 was that she should have played like this with Peter Kennedy. He moved
 her no more than a log of wood. Then she was suddenly ashamed, her
 cheeks dyed red in the darkness.
 
 
 
 
                                CHAPTER X
 
 
 She was surprised at what had happened to her, thought a great deal
 about it, magnifying or minimising it according to her mood. But in a
 way the incident drew her more definitely toward Gabriel Stanton. She
 began to admit she was in love with him, to do as he had bidden her,
 “let herself go.” In imagination at least. Had she been a psychological
 instead of an epigrammatic novelist, she would have understood herself
 better. To me, writing her story at this headlong pace, it was
 nevertheless all quite clear. I had not to linger to find out why she
 did this or that, what spirit moved her. I knew all the time, for
 although none of my own novels ever had the success of “The Dangerous
 Age” I knew more about what the author wrote there than he did himself,
 much more. The Dangerous Age comes to a woman at all periods. With
 Margaret Capel it was seven years after her marriage and over six from
 the time when she had left her husband. She was impulsive, and for all
 her introspective egotism, most pitifully ignorant of herself and her
 emotional capacity. Fortunately Gabriel Stanton was almost as ignorant
 as she. But, at least after that Sunday evening, there was no more talk
 of friendship between them. There was coquetting on her side and some
 obtuseness on his. Rare flashes of understanding as well, and on her
 part deepening feeling under a light and varying surface.
 
 She was rarely twice alike, often she merely acted, thinking of herself
 as a strange character in a drama. She was genuinely uncertain of
 herself. Her love flamed wild sometimes. Then she would pull herself up
 and remember that something like this she had felt once before, and it
 had proved a will o’ the wisp over a bog. She wanted to walk warily.
 
 “Supposing I am wrong again this time?” she asked him once with wide
 eyes.
 
 “You are not. This is real. Trust me, trust yourself.” She liked to
 nestle in the shelter of his arm, to feel his lips on her hair, to
 torment and adore him. The week-ends seemed very short; the week-days
 long. Week-days during which she was restless and excitable, and Peter
 Kennedy and his bag of tricks, medical tricks, often in request. She was
 very capricious with Peter, calling him ignorant, and a country yokel.
 As a companion he compared very badly with Gabriel. As an emotional
 machine he was easier to play upon. She spared him nothing, he was her
 whipping-boy. Watching him one noticed that he grew quieter, improved in
 many ways as she secured more and more mastery over him. When there were
 scenes now they were of her and not of his making. He was wax in her
 hands, plastic to her moulding. Sometimes she was sorry for him and a
 little ashamed of herself. Then she gave him a music lesson or lectured
 him gravely on his shortcomings. But from first to last he was nothing
 to her but a stop-gap. His devotion had the smallest of reward.
 
 The weeks went by. Gabriel Stanton coming and going, staying always at
 the local hotel. Ever more secure in his position with her, but never
 taking advantage of it.
 
 “He is naturally of a cold nature,” she argued. And once her confidant
 was Peter Kennedy and she compared the two of them. This was in early
 days, before her treatment of Peter had subdued him.
 
 “What’s he afraid of?” Peter asked brusquely.
 
 “Until the decree has been made absolute I am not free.”
 
 “So what he is afraid of is the King’s Proctor?”
 
 “Don’t.”
 
 “His precious respectability, the great house of Stanton.”
 
 “You take it all wrong, you don’t understand. How should you?”
 
 “Don’t I? I wish I’d half his chances.”
 
 “You are really not in the same category of men. It is banal—I have
 never fully realised the value of a banal phrase before, but you are
 ‘not fit to wipe the mud off his shoes.’”
 
 “Because I am a country doctor.”
 
 “Because you are—Peter Kennedy.”
 
 She knew then how comparatively thick-skinned he was; that if he had
 some sense or senses _in excelsis_, in others he was lacking, altogether
 lacking and unconscious. It is not paradoxical but plain that the more
 she saw of Gabriel Stanton the less heed she took of Peter Kennedy’s
 freedom of speech and ways. The two men were as apart as the poles, that
 they both adored her proved nothing but her undoubted charm. She was not
 quite looking forward, like Gabriel Stanton, through the “decree
 absolute” to marriage. She lived in the immediate present; in the
 Saturdays to Mondays when she tortured Gabriel Stanton and in a way was
 tortured by him. For she had never met so fine a brain, nor honour and
 simplicity so clean and clear, and she was upborne by and with him. And
 the Tuesdays to Fridays she had attacks or crises of the nerves and
 Kennedy alternately doctored and clumsily courted her.
 
 There came a time when she wrote and asked Gabriel to bring his sister
 next time he came, and that both of them should stay in the house with
 her, at Carbies. It was clear, if it had not been put into actual words,
 that they would marry as soon as she was free, and she thought it would
 please him that she should recognise the position.
 
 “I want to know her. Tell her I am a friend of yours who is interested
 in Christian Science, then she won’t think it strange that I should
 invite her here.” She was not frank enough to say “since she is to be my
 sister-in-law.”
 
 Gabriel, nevertheless, was translated when the letter came, and answered
 it rapturously. The invitation to his sister seemed to admit his
 footing, to make the future more definite and domestic.
 
   But if you want me to stay away I will stay away. Remember it is
   your wishes not mine that count. I tired you, perhaps? Did I tire
   you? God bless you!
 
   I can never tell you half that is in my heart. You are an angel of
   goodness, and I am on my knees before you all the time. I will tell
   Anne as little as possible until you give me permission, yet I am
   sure she must guess the rest. My voice alters when I speak of you,
   although I try to keep it even and calm. I went to her when I got
   your letter. “A friend of mine wants to know you.” I began as
   absurdly as that. She looked at me in surprise, and I went on
   hurriedly, “She wants you to go down with me to her house in
   Pineland at the end of the week....”
 
   “You have been there before?” she asked suspiciously, sharply. “Is
   that where you have been each week lately?”
 
   “Yes,” I answered, priding myself that I did not go on to tell her
   each week I entered Paradise, lingered there a little while. She
   began to question, probe me. Were you old, young, beautiful; the
   questions poured forth. Somehow or other, in the end these questions
   froze and silenced me. I could not tell her, you were you! She would
   not have understood. Nor was I able to satisfy her completely on any
   point. I could not describe you, felt myself stammering like a
   schoolboy over the colour of your hair, your eyes. How could I say
   to her “This sweet lady who invites you to make her acquaintance is
   just perfection, no more nor less; all compound of fire and dew,
   made composite and credible with genius”? As for giving a
   description of you, it would need a poet and a painter working
   together, and in the end they would give up the task in despair. I
   did not tell Anne this.
 
   She is now reviewing her wardrobe. And I ... I am reviewing
   nothing ... past definite thought. Do you know that when I left you
   on Sunday I feared that I had vexed or disappointed you again? You
   seemed to me a little cold—constrained. Monday and Tuesday I have
   examined and cross-examined myself—suffered. My whole life is
   yours—but if I fail to please you! I was in a hotel in the country
   once, when a man was brought in from the football field, very badly
   hurt. His eyes were shut, his face agonised; he moaned, for all his
   fortitude. There was a doctor in the crowd that accompanied him, who
   gave what seemed to me a strange order: “Put him in a hot bath, just
   as he is, don’t delay a moment; don’t wait to undress him.” My own
   bath was just prepared and I proffered it. They lowered him in. He
   was a fine big fellow, but suffering beyond self-restraint. Within a
   minute of the water reaching him, clothes on and everything, he left
   off moaning. His face grew calm. “My God! I am in heaven!” he
   exclaimed.
 
   “The relief must have been exquisite. I thought of the incident when
   your letter came, when I had submerged myself in it. I had forgotten
   it for years, but remembered it then. I too had passed in one moment
   from exquisite agony to a most wonderful calm. Dear love, how can I
   thank you! I am not going to try. Anne and I will come by the train
   arriving at Pineland at 4.52. I will not ask your kindness for her;
   I see you diffusing it. She will be grateful, and the form her
   gratitude will take will be the endeavour to convert you to
   Christian Science. My sweet darling, you will listen gravely,
   patiently. And I shall know it will be for me. I have done nothing
   to deserve you, am nothing, only your worshipper. Some day perhaps
   you will let me do something for you. Dear heart, I love you, love
   you, love you, however I write.”
 
                                                                  G. S.
 
 Friday, Margaret decided it was better that she should entertain her
 guests alone. She had to learn the idiosyncrasies of this poor sister of
 her lover’s, to acclimatise herself to a new atmosphere between herself
 and Gabriel. She invited Peter Kennedy to dine with them on Saturday,
 but bade him not to speak lightly of Christian Science.
 
 “What’s the game?” he asked her.
 
 “I think it is probably some form of mesmerism; I don’t quite know.
 Anyway Mr. Stanton’s sister is an invalid and thinks Christian Science
 has relieved her. You are not to laugh at or argue with her.”
 
 “I am to dine here and talk to her, I suppose, whilst you and that
 fellow ogle and make love to each other.” She turned a cold shoulder to
 him.
 
 “I withdraw my invitation, you need not come at all.”
 
 “Of course I shall come. And what is the name of the thing? Christian
 Science? I’ll get it up. You know I’d do anything on earth you asked me,
 though you treat me like a dog.”
 
 “At least you snatch an occasional bone,” she smiled as he mumbled her
 hand.
 
 Margaret sent for Mary Baker Eddy’s “Science and Health; with a Key to
 the Scriptures,” and spent the emptiest two hours she could remember in
 trying to master the viewpoint of the book, the essential dogma. Failing
 completely she flung it to Peter Kennedy, who read aloud to her sentence
 after sentence as illuminative as these:
 
 “‘_Destructive electricity is not the offspring of infinite good._’ Who
 the devil said it was?”
 
 “Hush, go on. There must be something more in it than that.” He turned
 to the title-page, “‘Printed and published at Earlswood’? No, my
 mistake—at Boston. ‘_Christian Science rationally explains that all
 other pathological methods are the fruits of human faith in matter, in
 the working, not of spirit, but of the fleshly mind, which must yield to
 Science._’ Don’t knit your brows. What’s the good of swotting at it?
 Let’s say Abracadabra to her and see what happens.”
 
 “What an indolent man you are. Is that the way you worked at your
",Twilight
30," 
 “Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”
 
 He was a large man, with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a
 broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled
 brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his
 extended hand, recalled Holmes’s surmise as to his habits. His rusty
 black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned
 up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of
 cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words
 with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and
 letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
 
 “We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we
 expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at
 a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”
 
 Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been
 so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt
 that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat
 and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt
 at recovering them.”
 
 “Very naturally. By-the-way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat
 it.”
 
 “To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
 
 “Yes, it would have been of no use to any one had we not done so. But
 I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the
 same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”
 
 “Oh, certainly, certainly;” answered Mr. Baker, with a sigh of relief.
 
 “Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your
 own bird, so if you wish—”
 
 The man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as
 relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see
 what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be
 to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my
 attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his
 shoulders.
 
 “There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By-the-way,
 would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am
 somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown
 goose.”
 
 “Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly-gained
 property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the ‘Alpha
 Inn,’ near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during
 the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,
 instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence
 every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were
 duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,
 sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.”
 With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
 strode off upon his way.
 
 “So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes, when he had closed the door
 behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about
 the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”
 
 “Not particularly.”
 
 “Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper, and follow up
 this clew while it is still hot.”
 
 “By all means.”
 
 It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats
 about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a
 cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke
 like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly
 as we swung through the Doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley
 Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter
 of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the “Alpha Inn,” which is a small
 public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into
 Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar, and ordered
 two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
 
 “Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.
 
 “My geese!” The man seemed surprised.
 
 “Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was
 a member of your goose club.”
 
 “Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.”
 
 “Indeed! Whose, then?”
 
 “Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”
 
 “Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”
 
 “Breckinridge is his name.”
 
 “Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health, landlord, and
 prosperity to your house. Good-night?”
 
 “Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat, as we
 came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson, that though we have
 so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the
 other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless
 we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but
 confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation
 which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has
 placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to
 the south, then, and quick march!”
 
 We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag
 of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the
 name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsey-looking man,
 with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up
 the shutters.
 
 “Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.
 
 The salesman nodded, and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
 
 “Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare
 slabs of marble.
 
 “Let you have 500 to-morrow morning.”
 
 “That’s no good.”
 
 “Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”
 
 “Ah, but I was recommended to you.”
 
 “Who by?”
 
 “The landlord of the ‘Alpha.’”
 
 “Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”
 
 “Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”
 
 To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.
 
 “Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms
 akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”
 
 “It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese
 which you supplied to the ‘Alpha.’”
 
 “Well, then, I sha’n’t tell you. So now!”
 
 “Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should
 be so warm over such a trifle.”
 
 “Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When
 I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the
 business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the
 geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they
 were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over
 them.”
 
 “Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making
 inquiries,” said Holmes, carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is
 off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter
 of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”
 
 “Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the
 salesman.
 
 “It’s nothing of the kind.”
 
 “I say it is.”
 
 “I don’t believe it.”
 
 “D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them
 ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the
 ‘Alpha’ were town bred.”
 
 “You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”
 
 “Will you bet, then?”
 
 “It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll
 have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”
 
 The salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.
 
 The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
 greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.
 
 “Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out
 of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left
 in my shop. You see this little book?”
 
 “Well?”
 
 “That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then,
 here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their
 names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then!
 You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town
 suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”
 
 “Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.
 
 “Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”
 
 Holmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott,
 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”
 
 “Now, then, what’s the last entry?”
 
 “‘December 22. Twenty-four geese at 7_s._ 6_d._’”
 
 “Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”
 
 “‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the ‘Alpha,’ at 12_s._’”
 
 “What have you to say now?”
 
 Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his
 pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of
 a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped
 under a lamp-post, and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which
 was peculiar to him.
 
 “When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘pink ‘un’
 protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said
 he. “I dare say that if I had put £100 down in front of him, that man
 would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from
 him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we
 are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which
 remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs.
 Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is
 clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides
 ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”
 
 His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out
 from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little
 rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
 which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge the salesman,
 framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the
 cringing figure.
 
 “I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were
 all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your
 silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and
 I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese
 off you?”
 
 “No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.
 
 “Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”
 
 “She told me to ask you.”
 
 “Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough
 of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer
 flitted away into the darkness.
 
 “Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come
 with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding
 through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring
 stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him
 upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gaslight
 that every vestige of color had been driven from his face.
 
 “Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked, in a quavering voice.
 
 “You will excuse me,” said Holmes, blandly, “but I could not help
 overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I
 think that I could be of assistance to you.”
 
 “You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”
 
 “My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other
 people don’t know.”
 
 “But you can know nothing of this?”
 
 “Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavoring to trace some
 geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman
 named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the ‘Alpha,’
 and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”
 
 “Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the
 little fellow, with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can
 hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case
 we had better discuss it in a cosey room rather than in this windswept
 market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it
 is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”
 
 The man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he
 answered, with a sidelong glance.
 
 “No, no; the real name,” said Holmes, sweetly. “It is always awkward
 doing business with an _alias_.”
 
 A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well, then,” said
 he, “my real name is James Ryder.”
 
 “Precisely so. Head attendant at the ‘Hotel Cosmopolitan.’ Pray step
 into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you
 would wish to know.”
 
 The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
 half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he
 is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into
 the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker
 Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin
 breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of
 his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.
 
 “Here we are!” said Holmes, cheerily, as we filed into the room. “The
 fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.
 Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we
 settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what
 became of those geese?”
 
 “Yes, sir.”
 
 “Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine, in
 which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”
 
 Ryder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me
 where it went to?”
 
 “It came here.”
 
 “Here?”
 
 “Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you
 should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the
 bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here
 in my museum.”
 
 Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantel-piece with
 his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box, and held up the blue
 carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,
 many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain
 whether to claim or to disown it.
 
 “The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes, quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll
 be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not
 got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of
 brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to
 be sure!”
 
 For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought
 a tinge of color into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened
 eyes at his accuser.
 
 “I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could
 possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that
 little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had
 heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”
 
 “It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he, in a crackling
 voice.
 
 “I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden
 wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for
 better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means
 you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very
 pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had
 been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would
 rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some
 small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you
 managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you
 rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
 arrested. You then—”
 
 Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
 companion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think
 of my father! of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went
 wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible.
 Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”
 
 “Get back into your chair!” said Holmes, sternly. “It is very well to
 cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner
 in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”
 
 “I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge
 against him will break down.”
 
 “Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of
 the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose
 into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope
 of safety.”
 
 [Illustration: “‘HAVE MERCY!’ HE SHRIEKED”]
 
 Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it
 just as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it
 seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone
 at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take
 it into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about
 the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission,
 and I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott,
 and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.
 All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a
 detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring
 down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what
 was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been
 upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard
 and smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.
 
 “I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just
 been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell
 into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what
 they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two
 things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where
 he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to
 turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought
 of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might
 at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone
 in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time,
 and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and
 suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
 best detective that ever lived.
 
 “My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of
 her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as
 good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry
 my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind
 this I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred
 tail. I caught it, and, prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down
 its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I
 felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the
 creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what
 was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
 fluttered off among the others.
 
 “‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.
 
 “‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was
 feeling which was the fattest.’
 
 “‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call
 it. It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them,
 which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’
 
 “‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d
 rather have that one I was handling just now.’
 
 “‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened
 it expressly for you.’
 
 “‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.
 
 “‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you
 want, then?’
 
 “‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
 flock.’
 
 “‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’
 
 “Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the
 way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that
 it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked,
 and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for
 there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake
 had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried
 into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.
 
 “‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.
 
 “‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’
 
 “‘Which dealer’s?’
 
 “‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’
 
 “‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the
 one I chose?’
 
 “‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell
 them apart.’
 
 “Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet
 would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at
 once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You
 heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like
 that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I
 am myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever
 having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!
 God help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in
 his hands.
 
 There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing, and by
 the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’s finger-tips upon the edge of
 the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
 
 “Get out!” said he.
 
 “What, sir! Oh, heaven bless you!”
 
 “No more words. Get out!”
 
 And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the
 stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls
 from the street.
 
 “After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay
 pipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If
 Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will
 not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am
 commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.
 This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.
 Send him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life. Besides,
 it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most
 singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.
 If you will have the goodness to touch the bell, doctor, we will
 begin another investigation, in which, also, a bird will be the chief
 feature.”
 
 
 
 
 Adventure VIII
 
 THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
 
 
 On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have
 during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock
 Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,
 but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his
 art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself
 with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even
 the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any
 which presented more singular features than that which was associated
 with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The
 events in question occurred in the early days of my association with
 Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It
 is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a
 promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been
 freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom
 the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now
 come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are wide-spread
 rumors as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the
 matter even more terrible than the truth.
 
 It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find
 Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was
 a late riser as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel-piece showed
 me that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked up at him in some
 surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself
 regular in my habits.
 
 “Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot
 this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,
 and I on you.”
 
 “What is it, then—a fire?”
 
 “No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable
 state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in
 the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis
 at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their
 beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to
 communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am
 sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I
 should call you and give you the chance.”
 
 “My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”
 
 I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional
 investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as
 intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he
 unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on
 my clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down
 to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who
 had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.
 
 “Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes, cheerily. “My name is Sherlock
 Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before
 whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see
 that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up
 to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that
 you are shivering.”
 
 “It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman, in a low voice,
 changing her seat as requested.
 
 “What, then?”
 
 “It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she
 spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of
 agitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes,
 like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of
 a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature gray, and her
 expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one
 of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.
 
 “You must not fear,” said he, soothingly, bending forward and patting
 her forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You
 have come in by train this morning, I see.”
 
 “You know me, then?”
 
 “No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of
 your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good
 drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”
 
 The lady gave a violent start, and stared in bewilderment at my
 companion.
 
 “There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm
 of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The
 marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which
 throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand
 side of the driver.”
 
 “Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I
 started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and
 came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no
 longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,
 save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little
 aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.
 Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from
 her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could
 help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense
",Holmes
31," 
 Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver,
 than he uttered a loud cry. Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and
 one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the
 hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.
 
 “Here he is!” bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up
 the staircase; “here’s one of the thieves, ma’am! Here’s a thief, miss!
 Wounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.”
 
 “—In a lantern, miss,” cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of
 his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.
 
 The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.
 Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in
 endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be
 hanged. In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a
 sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.
 
 “Giles!” whispered the voice from the stair-head.
 
 “I’m here, miss,” replied Mr. Giles. “Don’t be frightened, miss; I
 ain’t much injured. He didn’t make a very desperate resistance, miss! I
 was soon too many for him.”
 
 “Hush!” replied the young lady; “you frighten my aunt as much as the
 thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?”
 
 “Wounded desperate, miss,” replied Giles, with indescribable
 complacency.
 
 “He looks as if he was a-going, miss,” bawled Brittles, in the same
 manner as before. “Wouldn’t you like to come and look at him, miss, in
 case he should?”
 
 “Hush, pray; there’s a good man!” rejoined the lady. “Wait quietly only
 one instant, while I speak to aunt.”
 
 With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped
 away. She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was
 to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles’s room; and that
 Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to
 Chertsey: from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a
 constable and doctor.
 
 “But won’t you take one look at him, first, miss?” asked Mr. Giles,
 with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he
 had skilfully brought down. “Not one little peep, miss?”
 
 “Not now, for the world,” replied the young lady. “Poor fellow! Oh!
 treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!”
 
 The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a
 glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then,
 bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and
 solicitude of a woman.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXIX.
 HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH
 OLIVER RESORTED
 
 
 In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of
 old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at
 a well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care
 in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his
 station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table;
 and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back,
 and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and
 his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by
 his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very
 agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.
 
 Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed
 oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed
 with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone
 costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which
 rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its
 effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the
 table before her. Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their
 brightness) were attentively upon her young companion.
 
 The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood;
 at that age, when, if ever angels be for God’s good purposes enthroned
 in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in
 such as hers.
 
 She was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so
 mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her
 element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions. The very
 intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her
 noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the
 changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights
 that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the
 smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside
 peace and happiness.
 
 She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to
 raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put
 back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into
 her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless
 loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.
 
 “And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?” asked the old
 lady, after a pause.
 
 “An hour and twelve minutes, ma’am,” replied Mr. Giles, referring to a
 silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.
 
 “He is always slow,” remarked the old lady.
 
 “Brittles always was a slow boy, ma’am,” replied the attendant. And
 seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of
 thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a
 fast one.
 
 “He gets worse instead of better, I think,” said the elder lady.
 
 “It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other
 boys,” said the young lady, smiling.
 
 Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a
 respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out
 of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door:
 and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process,
 burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the
 breakfast-table together.
 
 “I never heard of such a thing!” exclaimed the fat gentleman. “My dear
 Mrs. Maylie—bless my soul—in the silence of the night, too—I _never_
 heard of such a thing!”
 
 With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands
 with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found
 themselves.
 
 “You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,” said the fat
 gentleman. “Why didn’t you send? Bless me, my man should have come in a
 minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or
 anybody, I’m sure, under such circumstances. Dear, dear! So unexpected!
 In the silence of the night, too!”
 
 The doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having
 been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the
 established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact
 business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two
 previous.
 
 “And you, Miss Rose,” said the doctor, turning to the young lady, “I—”
 
 “Oh! very much so, indeed,” said Rose, interrupting him; “but there is
 a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.”
 
 “Ah! to be sure,” replied the doctor, “so there is. That was your
 handiwork, Giles, I understand.”
 
 Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights,
 blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour.
 
 “Honour, eh?” said the doctor; “well, I don’t know; perhaps it’s as
 honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at
 twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you’ve fought a duel,
 Giles.”
 
 Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust
 attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was
 not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it
 was no joke to the opposite party.
 
 “Gad, that’s true!” said the doctor. “Where is he? Show me the way.
 I’ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That’s the little
 window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn’t have believed it!”
 
 Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is
 going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a
 surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles
 round as “the doctor,” had grown fat, more from good-humour than from
 good living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old
 bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer
 alive.
 
 The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had
 anticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom
 bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs
 perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something
 important was going on above. At length he returned; and in reply to an
 anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed
 the door, carefully.
 
 “This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,” said the doctor,
 standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.
 
 “He is not in danger, I hope?” said the old lady.
 
 “Why, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the
 circumstances,” replied the doctor; “though I don’t think he is. Have
 you seen the thief?”
 
 “No,” rejoined the old lady.
 
 “Nor heard anything about him?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “I beg your pardon, ma’am, interposed Mr. Giles; “but I was going to
 tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.”
 
 The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his
 mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. Such commendations had
 been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him,
 help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during
 which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for
 undaunted courage.
 
 “Rose wished to see the man,” said Mrs. Maylie, “but I wouldn’t hear of
 it.”
 
 “Humph!” rejoined the doctor. “There is nothing very alarming in his
 appearance. Have you any objection to see him in my presence?”
 
 “If it be necessary,” replied the old lady, “certainly not.”
 
 “Then I think it is necessary,” said the doctor; “at all events, I am
 quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you
 postponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me—Miss
 Rose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my
 honour!”
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXX.
 RELATES WHAT OLIVER’S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM
 
 
 With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised
 in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady’s arm
 through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie,
 led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.
 
 “Now,” said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of
 a bedroom-door, “let us hear what you think of him. He has not been
 shaved very recently, but he don’t look at all ferocious
 notwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in visiting
 order.”
 
 Stepping before them, he looked into the room. Motioning them to
 advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back
 the curtains of the bed. Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged
 ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with
 pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound
 and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon
 the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed
 over the pillow.
 
 The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a
 minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the
 younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the
 bedside, gathered Oliver’s hair from his face. As she stooped over him,
 her tears fell upon his forehead.
 
 The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity
 and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection
 he had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of
 water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a
 familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes
 that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some
 brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have
 awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.
 
 “What can this mean?” exclaimed the elder lady. “This poor child can
 never have been the pupil of robbers!”
 
 “Vice,” said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, “takes up her abode in
 many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine
 her?”
 
 “But at so early an age!” urged Rose.
 
 “My dear young lady,” rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his
 head; “crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered
 alone. The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.”
 
 “But, can you—oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has
 been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?” said
 Rose.
 
 The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared
 it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the
 patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.
 
 “But even if he has been wicked,” pursued Rose, “think how young he is;
 think that he may never have known a mother’s love, or the comfort of a
 home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven
 him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for
 mercy’s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child
 to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of
 amendment. Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want
 of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done
 so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor
 child, have pity upon him before it is too late!”
 
 “My dear love,” said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to
 her bosom, “do you think I would harm a hair of his head?”
 
 “Oh, no!” replied Rose, eagerly.
 
 “No, surely,” said the old lady; “my days are drawing to their close:
 and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to
 save him, sir?”
 
 “Let me think, ma’am,” said the doctor; “let me think.”
 
 Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns
 up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his
 toes, and frowning frightfully. After various exclamations of “I’ve got
 it now” and “no, I haven’t,” and as many renewals of the walking and
 frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:
 
 “I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles,
 and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful
 fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a
 thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You
 don’t object to that?”
 
 “Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,” replied Mrs.
 Maylie.
 
 “There is no other,” said the doctor. “No other, take my word for it.”
 
 “Then my aunt invests you with full power,” said Rose, smiling through
 her tears; “but pray don’t be harder upon the poor fellows than is
 indispensably necessary.”
 
 “You seem to think,” retorted the doctor, “that everybody is disposed
 to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for
 the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as
 vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow
 who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that
 I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for
 doing so, as the present.”
 
 “You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,” returned Rose,
 blushing.
 
 “Well,” said the doctor, laughing heartily, “that is no very difficult
 matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is
 yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I
 have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn’t
 be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse
 with him without danger. Now I make this stipulation—that I shall
 examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we
 judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he
 is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall
 be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at
 all events.”
 
 “Oh no, aunt!” entreated Rose.
 
 “Oh yes, aunt!” said the doctor. “Is is a bargain?”
 
 “He cannot be hardened in vice,” said Rose; “It is impossible.”
 
 “Very good,” retorted the doctor; “then so much the more reason for
 acceding to my proposition.”
 
 Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down
 to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.
 
 The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial
 than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed
 on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before
 the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at
 length sufficiently restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he
 said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled
 with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give
 him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next
 morning: which he should otherwise have done.
 
 The conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history,
 and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a
 solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the
 sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which
 hard men had brought upon him. Oh! if when we oppress and grind our
 fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of
 human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it
 is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance
 on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep
 testimony of dead men’s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride
 shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering,
 misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day’s life brings with it!
 
 Oliver’s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness
 and virtue watched him as he slept. He felt calm and happy, and could
 have died without a murmur.
 
 The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to
 rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them
 for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr.
 Giles. And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that
 he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the
 kitchen; so into the kitchen he went.
 
 There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament,
 the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had
 received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of
 the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable. The
 latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and
 large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a
 proportionate allowance of ale—as indeed he had.
 
 The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for
 Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor
 entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating
 everything, before his superior said it.
 
 “Sit still!” said the doctor, waving his hand.
 
 “Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Giles. “Misses wished some ale to be given
 out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir,
 and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among ’em here.”
 
 Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen
 generally were understood to express the gratification they derived
 from Mr. Giles’s condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a
 patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved
 properly, he would never desert them.
 
 “How is the patient to-night, sir?” asked Giles.
 
 “So-so”; returned the doctor. “I am afraid you have got yourself into a
 scrape there, Mr. Giles.”
 
 “I hope you don’t mean to say, sir,” said Mr. Giles, trembling, “that
 he’s going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I
 wouldn’t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the
 plate in the county, sir.”
 
 “That’s not the point,” said the doctor, mysteriously. “Mr. Giles, are
 you a Protestant?”
 
 “Yes, sir, I hope so,” faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.
 
 “And what are _you_, boy?” said the doctor, turning sharply upon
 Brittles.
 
 “Lord bless me, sir!” replied Brittles, starting violently; “I’m the
 same as Mr. Giles, sir.”
 
 “Then tell me this,” said the doctor, “both of you, both of you! Are
 you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is
 the boy that was put through the little window last night? Out with it!
 Come! We are prepared for you!”
 
 The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered
 creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger,
 that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and
 excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.
 
 “Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?” said the doctor,
 shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the
 bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy’s
 utmost acuteness. “Something may come of this before long.”
 
 The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of
 office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.
 
 “It’s a simple question of identity, you will observe,” said the
 doctor.
 
 “That’s what it is, sir,” replied the constable, coughing with great
 violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had
 gone the wrong way.
 
 “Here’s the house broken into,” said the doctor, “and a couple of men
 catch one moment’s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke,
 and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here’s a boy comes to
 that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his
 arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him—by doing which, they
 place his life in great danger—and swear he is the thief. Now, the
 question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in
 what situation do they place themselves?”
 
 The constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn’t law, he would
 be glad to know what was.
 
 “I ask you again,” thundered the doctor, “are you, on your solemn
 oaths, able to identify that boy?”
 
 Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at
 Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the
 reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the
 doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at
 the same moment, the sound of wheels.
 
 “It’s the runners!” cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.
 
 “The what?” exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.
 
 “The Bow Street officers, sir,” replied Brittles, taking up a candle;
 “me and Mr. Giles sent for ’em this morning.”
 
 “What?” cried the doctor.
 
 “Yes,” replied Brittles; “I sent a message up by the coachman, and I
 only wonder they weren’t here before, sir.”
 
 “You did, did you? Then confound your—slow coaches down here; that’s
 all,” said the doctor, walking away.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXI.
 INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION
 
 
 “Who’s that?” inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with
 the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.
 
 “Open the door,” replied a man outside; “it’s the officers from Bow
 Street, as was sent to to-day.”
 
 Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full
 width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in,
 without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly
 as if he lived there.
 
 “Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?” said
 the officer; “he’s in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have you got a coach
 ’us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?”
 
 Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building,
 the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his
 companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of
 great admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being
 shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed
 like what they were.
 
 The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle
 height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close;
 half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes. The other was a
 red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured
 countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.
 
 “Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?” said the
 stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on
 the table. “Oh! Good-evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you
 in private, if you please?”
 
 This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that
 gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and
 shut the door.
 
 “This is the lady of the house,” said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards
 Mrs. Maylie.
 
 Mr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on
 the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The
 latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good
 society, or quite so much at his ease in it—one of the two—seated
 himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and
 the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.
 
 “Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,” said Blathers. “What
 are the circumstances?”
 
 Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at
 great length, and with much circumlocution. Messrs. Blathers and Duff
 looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.
 
 “I can’t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,” said
 Blathers; “but my opinion at once is,—I don’t mind committing myself to
 that extent,—that this wasn’t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?”
 
 “Certainly not,” replied Duff.
 
 “And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I
 apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a
 countryman?” said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.
 
 “That’s it, master,” replied Blathers. “This is all about the robbery,
 is it?”
 
 “All,” replied the doctor.
 
 “Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking
 on?” said Blathers.
 
 “Nothing at all,” replied the doctor. “One of the frightened servants
 chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this
 attempt to break into the house; but it’s nonsense: sheer absurdity.”
 
 “Wery easy disposed of, if it is,” remarked Duff.
 
 “What he says is quite correct,” observed Blathers, nodding his head in
 a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if
 they were a pair of castanets. “Who is the boy? What account does he
 give of himself? Where did he come from? He didn’t drop out of the
 clouds, did he, master?”
 
 “Of course not,” replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two
 ladies. “I know his whole history: but we can talk about that
 presently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves
 made their attempt, I suppose?”
 
 “Certainly,” rejoined Mr. Blathers. “We had better inspect the premises
 first, and examine the servants afterwards. That’s the usual way of
 doing business.”
 
 Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by
 the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short,
 went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at
 the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in
 at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the
 shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with;
 and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with. This done, amidst
 the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr.
 Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of
 their share in the previous night’s adventures: which they performed
 some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one
 important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the
 last. This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the
 room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for
 secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest
 point in medicine, would be mere child’s play.
 
 Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy
 state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.
 
 “Upon my word,” he said, making a halt, after a great number of very
 rapid turns, “I hardly know what to do.”
 
 “Surely,” said Rose, “the poor child’s story, faithfully repeated to
 these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.”
 
 “I doubt it, my dear young lady,” said the doctor, shaking his head. “I
 don’t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal
 functionaries of a higher grade. What is he, after all, they would say?
 A runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his
 story is a very doubtful one.”
 
 “You believe it, surely?” interrupted Rose.
 
 “_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for
 doing so,” rejoined the doctor; “but I don’t think it is exactly the
 tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.”
 
 “Why not?” demanded Rose.
 
 “Because, my pretty cross-examiner,” replied the doctor: “because,
 viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can
 only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.
 Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and
 will take nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been
 the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a
 police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman’s pocket; he has
 been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman’s house, to a place
 which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he
 has not the remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who
 seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and
 is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very
 moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing
 that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a
 blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose
 to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don’t you see all this?”
 
 “I see it, of course,” replied Rose, smiling at the doctor’s
 impetuosity; “but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the
 poor child.”
 
 “No,” replied the doctor; “of course not! Bless the bright eyes of your
 sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any
 question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to
 them.”
 
 Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his
 hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even
 greater rapidity than before.
 
 “The more I think of it,” said the doctor, “the more I see that it will
 occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in
 possession of the boy’s real story. I am certain it will not be
 believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the
 dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will
 be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan
 of rescuing him from misery.”
 
 “Oh! what is to be done?” cried Rose. “Dear, dear! why did they send
 for these people?”
 
 “Why, indeed!” exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. “I would not have had them here,
 for the world.”
 
 “All I know is,” said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind
 of desperate calmness, “that we must try and carry it off with a bold
 face. The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. The boy
 has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be
 talked to any more; that’s one comfort. We must make the best of it;
 and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!”
 
 “Well, master,” said Blathers, entering the room followed by his
 colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. “This
 warn’t a put-up thing.”
 
 “And what the devil’s a put-up thing?” demanded the doctor,
 impatiently.
 
 “We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,” said Blathers, turning to them,
 as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor’s,
 “when the servants is in it.”
 
 “Nobody suspected them, in this case,” said Mrs. Maylie.
 
 “Wery likely not, ma’am,” replied Blathers; “but they might have been
 in it, for all that.”
 
 “More likely on that wery account,” said Duff.
 
 “We find it was a town hand,” said Blathers, continuing his report;
 “for the style of work is first-rate.”
 
 “Wery pretty indeed it is,” remarked Duff, in an undertone.
 
 “There was two of ’em in it,” continued Blathers; “and they had a boy
 with ’em; that’s plain from the size of the window. That’s all to be
 said at present. We’ll see this lad that you’ve got upstairs at once,
 if you please.”
 
 “Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?” said
 the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred
 to him.
 
 “Oh! to be sure!” exclaimed Rose, eagerly. “You shall have it
 immediately, if you will.”
 
 “Why, thank you, miss!” said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across
 his mouth; “it’s dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink that’s handy,
 miss; don’t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.”
 
 “What shall it be?” asked the doctor, following the young lady to the
 sideboard.
 
 “A little drop of spirits, master, if it’s all the same,” replied
 Blathers. “It’s a cold ride from London, ma’am; and I always find that
 spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.”
 
 This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who
 received it very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the
 doctor slipped out of the room.
 
 “Ah!” said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but
 grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand:
 and placing it in front of his chest; “I have seen a good many pieces
 of business like this, in my time, ladies.”
 
 “That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,” said Mr.
 Duff, assisting his colleague’s memory.
 
 “That was something in this way, warn’t it?” rejoined Mr. Blathers;
 “that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.”
 
 “You always gave that to him” replied Duff. “It was the Family Pet, I
 tell you. Conkey hadn’t any more to do with it than I had.”
 
 “Get out!” retorted Mr. Blathers; “I know better. Do you mind that time
 when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was!
 Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!”
 
 “What was that?” inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of
 good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.
 
 “It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down
 upon,” said Blathers. “This here Conkey Chickweed—”
 
 “Conkey means Nosey, ma’am,” interposed Duff.
 
 “Of course the lady knows that, don’t she?” demanded Mr. Blathers.
 “Always interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey Chickweed,
 miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar,
 where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and
 badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was
 conducted in, for I’ve seen ’em off’en. He warn’t one of the family, at
 that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and
 twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom
 in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye,
 who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the
 robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high. He was
 wery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a
 blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a
 hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about ’em, found that
 Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way
 to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost ’em. However,
 he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr.
 Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other
 bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don’t
 know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state
 of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or
 four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many
 people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day
 he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview
 with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and
 orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go
 and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house.
 ‘I see him, Spyers,’ said Chickweed, ‘pass my house yesterday morning,’
 ‘Why didn’t you up, and collar him!’ says Spyers. ‘I was so struck all
 of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,’
 says the poor man; ‘but we’re sure to have him; for between ten and
 eleven o’clock at night he passed again.’ Spyers no sooner heard this,
 than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he
 should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself
 down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain,
 with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment’s notice. He was
 smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed
 roars out, ‘Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!’ Jem Spyers dashes out; and
 there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry. Away goes
 Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out,
 ‘Thieves!’ and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like
 mad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots
 round; sees a little crowd; dives in; ‘Which is the man?’ ‘D—me!’ says
 Chickweed, ‘I’ve lost him again!’ It was a remarkable occurrence, but
 he warn’t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house.
 Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind
 the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his
 own two eyes ached again. At last, he couldn’t help shutting ’em, to
 ease ’em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed
 a-roaring out, ‘Here he is!’ Off he starts once more, with Chickweed
 half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as
 the yesterday’s one, the man’s lost again! This was done, once or twice
 more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been
 robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and
 the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.”
 
 “What did Jem Spyers say?” inquired the doctor; who had returned to the
 room shortly after the commencement of the story.
 
 “Jem Spyers,” resumed the officer, “for a long time said nothing at
 all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he
 understood his business. But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and
 taking out his snuffbox, says ‘Chickweed, I’ve found out who done this
 here robbery.’ ‘Have you?’ said Chickweed. ‘Oh, my dear Spyers, only
 let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers,
 where is the villain!’ ‘Come!’ said Spyers, offering him a pinch of
 snuff, ‘none of that gammon! You did it yourself.’ So he had; and a
 good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have
 found it out, if he hadn’t been so precious anxious to keep up
 appearances!” said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and
 clinking the handcuffs together.
 
 “Very curious, indeed,” observed the doctor. “Now, if you please, you
 can walk upstairs.”
 
 “If _you_ please, sir,” returned Mr. Blathers. Closely following Mr.
 Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver’s bedroom; Mr. Giles
 preceding the party, with a lighted candle.
 
 Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he
 had appeared yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in
 bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all
 understanding what was going forward—in fact, without seeming to
 recollect where he was, or what had been passing.
 
 “This,” said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence
 notwithstanding, “this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a
 spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d’ ye-call-him’s
 grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this
 morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that
 ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his
 life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.”
 
 Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus
 recommended to their notice. The bewildered butler gazed from them
 towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most
 ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.
 
 “You don’t mean to deny that, I suppose?” said the doctor, laying
 Oliver gently down again.
 
 “It was all done for the—for the best, sir,” answered Giles. “I am sure
 I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn’t have meddled with him. I am not
 of an inhuman disposition, sir.”
 
 “Thought it was what boy?” inquired the senior officer.
 
 “The housebreaker’s boy, sir!” replied Giles. “They—they certainly had
 a boy.”
 
 “Well? Do you think so now?” inquired Blathers.
 
 “Think what, now?” replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.
 
 “Think it’s the same boy, Stupid-head?” rejoined Blathers, impatiently.
 
 “I don’t know; I really don’t know,” said Giles, with a rueful
 countenance. “I couldn’t swear to him.”
 
 “What do you think?” asked Mr. Blathers.
 
 “I don’t know what to think,” replied poor Giles. “I don’t think it is
 the boy; indeed, I’m almost certain that it isn’t. You know it can’t
 be.”
 
 “Has this man been a-drinking, sir?” inquired Blathers, turning to the
 doctor.
 
 “What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!” said Duff, addressing Mr.
 Giles, with supreme contempt.
 
 Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient’s pulse during this short
 dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked,
 that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would
 perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.
 
 Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring
 apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and
 his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions
 and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on
 anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed,
 his declarations that he shouldn’t know the real boy, if he were put
 before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he,
 because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes
 previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much
 afraid he had been a little too hasty.
 
 Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether
 Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow
 pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more
 destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which
 made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had
 drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it
 make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after
 labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a
 fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to
 the utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very
 much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took
 up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next
 morning.
 
 With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were
 in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under
 suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff
 journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving
 themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been
 discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is
 only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the
 English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King’s subjects,
 held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence,
 that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with
 violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the
 punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise
",OliverTwist
32," “But this was before I knew you.”
 
 “Don’t you believe it. I never lived at all before you knew me.”
 
 “Absurd boy!”
 
 “I’m getting on for thirty.”
 
 “You can’t expect me to remember it whilst you behave as if you were
 seventeen. Take the book up again, let us give it an honest trial.”
 
 He read on obediently, and she listened with a real desire for
 instruction. Then all at once she put her fingers in her ears and called
 a halt.
 
 “That will do. Ring for tea, I can’t listen to any more....”
 
 He went on nevertheless: “‘_Mind is not the author of Matter._’ I say,
 this is jolly good. You can read it the other way too. ‘_Matter is not
 the author of mind. There is no matter ... put matter under the foot of
 mind._’ Put Mrs. Eddy under the foot of a militant suffragette. Oh! I
 say ... listen to this....”
 
 “No, I won’t, not to another word. Poor Gabriel....” He threw the book
 away.
 
 “Always that damned fellow!” he said.
 
 When Friday came and the house had been swept and garnished Margaret
 drove to the station to receive her guests. The room prepared for Anne
 was on the same corridor as her own, facing south, and with a balcony.
 Margaret herself had seen to all the little details for her comfort. A
 big sofa and easy-chair, pen and ink and paper, the latest novel:
 flowers on the mantelpiece and dressing-table, a filled biscuit box, and
 small spirit stand. Then, more slowly, she had gone into the little
 suite prepared for Gabriel, bedroom and bathroom, no balcony, but a wide
 window. She only stayed a moment, she did not give a thought to his
 little comforts. She was out of the room again quickly.
 
 She arrived late at the station, and Gabriel was already on the
 platform; he never had the same happy certainty as the first time, nor
 knew how she would greet him. The first impression she had of Anne was
 of a little old woman, bent-backed, fussing about the luggage, about
 some bag after which she enquired repeatedly and excitedly, of whose
 safety she could not be assured until Gabriel produced it to her from
 among the others already on the platform.
 
 “Shall we go on and leave him to follow with the luggage?” Margaret
 asked.
 
 “Oh, no, no, I couldn’t think of moving until it is found. So
 tiresome....”
 
 “I am sure you are tired after your journey.”
 
 “I don’t know what it is to be tired since I have taken up Christian
 Science. You know we are never tired unless we think we are,” Anne said,
 when they were in the carriage, bowling along the good road toward the
 reddening glow of the sunset. Margaret and Gabriel, sitting opposite,
 but not facing each other—embarrassed, shy with the memory of their last
 parting,—were glad of this intervening person who chattered of her
 non-fatigue, the essential bag, and the number of things she had had to
 see to before she left home. All the way from Pineland station to the
 crunching gravel path at Carbies Anne talked and they made a feint of
 listening to her. The feeling between them was a great height. They were
 almost glad of her presence, of her fretting small talk. Margaret said
 afterwards she felt damp and deluged with it, properly subdued. “I felt
 as if I had come all out of curl,” she told him. “No wonder you speak so
 little, are reserved.”
 
 “I am not reserved with you,” he answered.
 
 “I think sometimes that you are.”
 
 “There is not a corner or cranny of my mind I should not wish you to
 explore if it interested you,” he replied passionately.
 
 All that evening Anne’s volubility never failed. She was of the type of
 woman, domestic and frequent, who can talk for hours without succeeding
 in saying anything. Most of it seemed simultaneous! Anne Stanton, who
 was ten years older than Gabriel and had an idea that she “managed” him,
 prided herself also on her good social quality and capacity for carrying
 off a situation. She thought of this invitation and introduction to the
 young lady with whom her brother had evidently fallen in love as “a
 situation” and she felt herself of immense importance in it. Gabriel
 must have kept his secret better than he knew. She believed that he was
 seeking her opinion of his choice, that the decision, if there was to be
 a decision, rested with her. One must do her the justice to admit that
 she did not give a thought to any possible alteration in her own
 position. She had always lived with Gabriel, she knew he would not cast
 her off. Conscious of her adaptability she had already said to him on
 the way down:
 
 “I could live with anybody, any nice person, and, of course, since I
 have been so well everything is even easier. I do hope I shall like
 her....”
 
 She did like her, very much, Margaret saw to that, behaving exquisitely
 under the stimulus of Gabriel’s worshipping eyes; listening as if she
 were absorbedly interested in a description of the particular Healer who
 had Anne’s case in hand.
 
 “At first you see I was quite strange to it, I didn’t understand
 completely. Mr. Roope is a little deaf, but he says he hears as much as
 he wants to ... so beautifully content and devout.”
 
 “Has Mrs. Roope any defect?” Margaret got a word or two in edgeways
 before the end of the evening, her sense of humour helping her.
 
 “She has a sort of hysterical affection. She goes ‘Bupp, bupp,’ like a
 turkey-cock and swells at the throat. At least that is what I thought,
 but I am very backward at present. Some one asked her the cause once,
 when I was there, and she said she had no such habit, the mistake was
 ours. It is all very bewildering.”
 
 “Are there any other members of the family?”
 
 “Her dear mother! Such a nice creature, and quite a believer; she has
 gall-stones.”
 
 “Gall-stones!”
 
 “Not really, you know, they pass with prayer. She looks ill, very ill
 sometimes, but of course that is another of my mistakes. I am having
 absent treatment now.”
 
 “They know where you are?” Gabriel asked, perhaps a little anxiously.
 
 “Oh! dear, yes. I am never out of touch with them.”
 
 After she had retired for the night, for notwithstanding her immunity
 from fatigue and pain, she retired early, explaining that she wanted to
 put her things in order, Gabriel lingered to tell Margaret again what an
 angel she was, and of his gratitude to her for the way she was receiving
 and making much of his sister.
 
 “I like doing it, she interests me. I suppose she really believes in it
 all.”
 
 “I think so. You see her illness is partly nervous, partly her spine,
 but still to a certain extent, nervous. She is undoubtedly better since
 she had this hobby. The only thing that worries me is this family of
 whom she speaks, these Roopes. Of course they will get everything she
 has out of her, every penny. If it only stops at that....”
 
 “You have seen them?”
 
 “Not yet. I hear the man is an emaciated idler, not over-clean, his wife
 has evidently a bad form of St. Vitus’s dance. The woman leads them all,
 the old mother, all of them. I expect they live upon what she makes.
 I’ve heard a story or two ... I had not realized about this absent
 treatment, that Anne tells them where she goes. You don’t mind?”
 
 “Why should I mind?”
 
 “She may have told them I come here....”
 
 “Oh! that! I had forgotten.”
 
 It was true, she had forgotten that she must walk circumspectly. She had
 spoken of and forgotten it. Now she remembered, because he reminded her;
 reddened and wished she had not invited Anne. Anne, with her undesirable
 acquaintances and meandering talk, who would keep her and Gabriel
 company on their walks and drives for the next two days.
 
 But Providence, or a broken chain in the sequence of the Roope Christian
 Science treatment, came to her aid. On Saturday Anne was prostrated with
 headache.
 
 “She has never been able to bear a railway journey.”
 
 “Does she explain?”
 
 “I went in to see her. ‘If only I had faith enough,’ she moaned, and
 asked me to send Mrs. Roope a telegram. I persuaded her to five grains
 of aspirin, but I could see she felt very guilty about it. She will
 sleep until the afternoon.”
 
 “We can leave her?”
 
 “Oh, yes! I doubt if she will be well awake by dinner, certainly not
 before.”
 
 “Let us get away from here, from Carbies and Pineland....”
 
 “Right to the other side of the island. We could lunch at Ryde. I’ll get
 a car.”
 
 Nothing suited either of them so well today as a long silent drive. The
 car went too fast for them to talk. Retrospect or the comparison of
 notes was practically impossible. They sat side by side, smiling rarely,
 one at the other as the spring burst into life around them. The tall
 hedges were full of may blossom, with here and there a flowering
 currant, the trees wore their coronal of young green leaves, great
 clumps of primroses succeeded the yellow gorse of which they had tired,
 fields were already green with the autumn-sown corn, there was nothing
 to remind them of Carbies. For a long time the sea was out of sight.
 Never had they been happier together, for all they spoke so little.
 
 At Ryde he played the host to her, and she sat on the verandah whilst he
 went in to give his orders. A few ships were aride in the bay, but the
 scene was very different from what she had ever seen it before, in
 Regatta time, when it was gay with bunting and familiar faces. Today
 they had it to themselves, the hotel she only knew as overcrowded, and
 the view of the town, so strangely quiet. And excellent was the luncheon
 served to them. A lobster mayonnaise and a fillet steak, a pie of early
 gooseberries, which nevertheless Margaret declared were bottled. They
 spoke of other meals they had had together, of one in the British Museum
 in particular. On this occasion it pleased her to declare that boiled
 cod, not crimped, but flabby and served with lukewarm egg sauce, was the
 most ambrosial food she knew.
 
 “I don’t know when I enjoyed a meal so much,” she said reflectively.
 
 “You wrote and reproached me for it.” His eyes caressed and forgave her
 for it.
 
 “Impossible!”
 
 “You did indeed. I can produce your plaint in your own handwriting.”
 
 “You don’t mean to say you keep my letters!”
 
 “I would rather part with my Elzevirs.”
 
 This was the only time they approached sentiment, approached and sheered
 off. There was something between them, in wait for them, at which at
 that moment neither wished to look.
 
 The sun sparkled on the waters, a boatload of smart young naval officers
 put off from a strange yacht in the bay. Gabriel and Margaret wished
 that their landing at the pier should synchronise with their own
 departure. Nothing was to break the unusualness of their solitude in
 this whilom crowded place. He showed his tenderness in the way he
 cloaked her, tucked the rugs about her, not in any spoken word. She felt
 it subtly about her, and glowed in it, most amazingly content.
 
 When they got back to Carbies, after having satisfied herself that her
 guest had recovered and would join them at dinner, she astonished her
 maid by demanding an evening toilette. She wore a gown of grey and
 silver brocade, very stiff and Elizabethan, a chain of uncut cabochon
 emeralds hung round her neck, and a stomacher of the same decorated her
 corsage. The mauve osprey upstanding in her hair was clasped by a
 similar encrusted jewel. She carried herself regally. Had she not come
 into her woman’s Kingdom? Tonight she meant that he should see what he
 had won.
 
 It was a strange evening, nevertheless, and they were a strangely
 assorted quartette. There was a little glow of colour in Margaret’s
 cheeks, such as Peter Kennedy had never seen there before, her eyes
 shone like stars, and she wore this regal toilette. Peter was introduced
 to Anne. Anne, yellowish and subdued after the migraine, dressed in
 brown taffeta, opening at the wizened throat to display a locket of seed
 pearls on a gold chain; her brown toupée had slipped a little and
 discovered a few grey hairs, her hands, covered with inexpensive rings,
 showed clawlike and tremulous. Margaret’s unringed hands, so pale and
 small, were like Japanese flowers. Peter had to take in Anne. Gabriel
 gave his arm to Margaret. The poverty of the dining-room furniture was
 out of the circle of the white spread table, where the suspended lamp
 shone on fine silver and glass. Flowers came constantly to Carbies from
 London. Tonight red roses scented the room; hothouse roses, blooming
 before their time, on long thornless stems. Margaret drew a vase toward
 her, exclaimed at the wealth of perfume.
 
 “I only hope they won’t make your headache worse.”
 
 Anne tried to insist she had no headache. Peter advised a glass of
 champagne. She began to tell him something of her new-found panacea for
 all ills, but ceased upon finding he was what she called a “medical
 man,” one of the enemies of their creed. Before the dinner had passed
 the soup stage he hardly made a pretence of listening to her. Both men
 were absorbed in this regal Margaret. All her graciousness was for
 Gabriel, but she found occasion now and again for a smile and a word for
 Peter. Poor Peter! guest at this high feast where there was no food for
 him. But he made the most of the material provender, and proved
 fortunately to be an excellent trencherman. Otherwise Margaret’s good
 cook had exerted herself in vain. For none of them had appetite but
 Peter; Margaret because she talked too much, and Gabriel because he
 could do nothing but listen; Anne because she was feeling the
 after-effects, and regretting she had yielded to the temptation of the
 aspirin.
 
 The men sat together but a short time after the ladies left them. They
 had one subject in common of which neither wished to speak. Gabriel
 smoked only a cigarette, Peter praised the port, which happened to be
 exceptionally bad; the weather was a topic that drew blank. Fortunately
 they struck upon Pineland and its health-giving qualities, upon which
 both were enthusiastic. Peter Kennedy was in Gabriel’s secret, but
 Gabriel had no intuition of his.
 
 “Mrs. Capel seems to have derived great benefit from her stay. Probably
 from your treatment also,” he said courteously. His thoughts were so
 full of her; how could he speak of anything else?
 
 “I can’t do much for her,” Peter said gloomily. He had had the greater
 part of a bottle of champagne, and the port on the top of it. “She
 doesn’t do a thing I tell her. She doesn’t care whether I’m dead or
 alive.”
 
 “I am sure you are wrong,” Gabriel reassured him earnestly. “She has, I
 am sure, the highest possible opinion of your skill. She carries out
 your régime as far as possible. You think she should rest more?”
 
 “She should do nothing but rest.”
 
 “But with an active mind?”
 
 “It is not only her mind that is active.”
 
 “You mean the piano-playing, writing....”
 
 “She ought just to vegetate. She has a weak heart, one of the
 valves....”
 
 Gabriel rose hurriedly, it was not possible for him to listen to a
 description of his beloved’s physical ailments. He was shocked with
 Peter for wishing to tell him, genuinely shocked. It was a breach of
 professional etiquette, of good manners. They arrived upstairs in the
 music room completely out of tune.
 
 “He wouldn’t even listen when I told him how seedy you were, that you
 ought to be kept quiet. Selfish owl. You’ve been out with him all day.”
 
 “I rested for half an hour before dinner. Do I look tired or washed
 out?” She turned a radiant face to Peter for investigation. “I am going
 to play to you presently, when you will see if I am without power.”
 
 “Power! Who said you were without that? You’d have power over the devil
 tonight.”
 
 “Or over my eccentric physician.” She smiled at him. “Have you been
 behaving yourself prettily downstairs?”
 
 “I haven’t told him what I think of him, if that’s what you mean!”
 
 “Will you play first?” she asked him. Peter Kennedy was a genuine music
 lover, and he played well, very much better since Margaret Capel had
 come to Pineland. He sang also, but this accomplishment Margaret would
 never let him display. She had no use for a man’s singing since James
 Capel had lured her with his love songs.
 
 Gabriel was talking to his sister whilst Margaret and Peter had this
 little conversation. He was persuading her to an early retreat.
 
 “Did you send my telegram to Mrs. Roope? I am sure I am getting better,
 I have been thinking so all the evening. She must have been treating
 me.”
 
 “I am sure, but are not the vibrations stronger between you if you are
 alone, if there is nothing to disturb your thoughts?...” Even Gabriel
 Stanton could be disingenuous when the occasion demanded. She hesitated.
 
 “Wouldn’t Mrs. Capel be offended? One owes something to one’s hostess.
 She has promised to play. You told me she played beautifully. I do think
 she is very sweet. But, Gabriel, have you thought of the flat? I
 shouldn’t like to give it up. The gravel soil and air from the heath,
 and everything. Isn’t she ... isn’t she....”
 
 “A size too big for it?” He finished her sentence for her.
 
 “Too grand, I meant.”
 
 “Yes, too grand. Of course she is too grand.” He turned to look at her.
 This time their eloquent eyes met. She indicated the piano stool to
 Peter Kennedy and came swiftly to the brother and sister.
 
 “Has he made you comfortable?” She adjusted the pillows, and stole a
 glance at Gabriel. Whenever she looked at him it seemed that his eyes
 were upon her. They were extraordinarily conscious of each other, acting
 a little because Anne and Peter were there. Peter Kennedy, over on the
 music stool, struck a chord or two, as if to lure her back.
 
 “One can always listen better when one is comfortable,” she said to
 Anne. Then went over to the fender stool, where Gabriel joined her,
 after a moment’s hesitation.
 
 “Isn’t it too hot for you?” she asked him innocently.
 
 “It might have been,” he answered, smiling, “only the fire is out.”
 
 “Is it?” she turned to look. “I had not noticed it. Hush! He is going to
 play the _Berceuse_. You haven’t heard him before, have you? He plays
 quite well.”
 
 So they sat there together whilst Peter Kennedy played, and every now
 and then Anne said from the sofa:
 
 “How delicious! Thank you ever so much. What was it? I thought I knew
 the piece.”
 
 Peter got up from the piano before Gabriel and Margaret had tired of
 sitting side by side on the fender stool, or Anne of ejaculating her
 little complimentary, grateful, or enquiring phrases.
 
 “I suppose you’ve had enough of it,” he said abruptly to Margaret.
 
 “No, I haven’t. You could have gone on for another hour.”
 
 “I daresay.”
 
 Gabriel thought his manner singularly abrupt, almost rude. This was only
 the second or third time he had met Margaret’s medical attendant, and he
 was not at all favourably impressed by him. As for Peter:
 
 “Damned dry stick,” he said to Margaret, when he had persuaded her to
 the redemption of her promise, and was leading her to the piano.
 
 “What a boor you really are, notwithstanding your playing,” she answered
 calmly, adjusting the candles, the height of the piano stool, looking
 out some music. “I really thought you were going to behave well tonight.
 And not a word about Christian Science,” she chaffed him gently, “after
 all the coaching.”
 
 She too tried a few chords.
 
 “I say, don’t you play too long tonight. Don’t you go overdoing it.” Her
 chaff made no impression upon him, he was used to it. But he was struck
 by some alteration or intensification of her brilliancy. How could he
 know the secret of it? The love of which he was capable gave him no key
 to the spell that was on those two tonight.
 
 Anne slipped off to bed presently, at Gabriel’s whispered encouragement,
 and Margaret went on playing to the two men. Peter commented sometimes,
 asked for this or the other, went over and stood by her side, turning
 over the music, sat down beside her now and again. Gabriel remained on
 the corner of the sofa Anne had vacated, and listened. Therefore it was
 Peter who caught her when she fell forward with a little sigh or moan,
 Peter who caught her up in his arms and strode over with her to the
 sofa. Gabriel would have taken her from him, but Peter issued impatient
 orders.
 
 “Open the window, pull the blind up, let us have as much air as
 possible. Ring for her maid, ring like blazes ... she has only fainted.”
 Within a minute she was sitting up, radiantly white, but with shadows
 round her pale mouth and deep under her eyes.
 
 “It is nothing, it is only a touch of faintness. Not an attack. Gabriel,
 you were not frightened?” she asked, and put out her hand to him.
 
 Peter said something inarticulate and got up from where he had been
 kneeling beside her.
 
 “I’ll get you some brandy.”
 
 “Shall I go?” Gabriel asked, but was holding her hand.
 
 “No, no. You stay. Dr. Kennedy knows where it is.”
 
 Gabriel knelt beside her now.
 
 “Were you frightened?” she asked, still a little faintly.
 
 “Love, lover, sweet, my heart was shaken with terror.”
 
 “It is really nothing. We have had such a wonderful day I was trying to
 play it all to you. Then the glory spread, brightened, overwhelmed
 me....”
 
 “Beloved!”
 
 “Hush! he is coming back. You won’t believe anything he tells you?”
 
 “Not if you tell me you are not really ill? Oh! my darling! I could not
 bear it if you were to suffer. Let me get some one else....”
 
 Peter was back with the brandy, a measured dose, he brushed Gabriel
 aside as if now at least he had the mastery of the position. For all
 Gabriel’s preoccupation with Margaret, Dr. Kennedy managed to attract
 from him a wondering moment of attention. Need he have knelt to
 administer the draught? What was it he was murmuring? Whatever it was
 Margaret was unwilling to hear. She leaned back, closing her eyes. When
 the maid came, torn reluctantly from her supper, she was able,
 nevertheless, to reassure her.
 
 “Nothing of consequence, Stevens, not an attack. I am going across to my
 bedroom. One of you will lend me an arm,” they were both in readiness,
 “or both.” She took an arm of one and an arm of the other, smiled in
 both their faces. “What a way to wind up our little evening! You will
 have to forgive me, entertain each other.”
 
 “I’ll come in again and see you when you are comfortable,” the doctor
 said, a little defiantly, Gabriel thought.
 
 “No, don’t wait. Not on any account. Stevens knows everything to do for
 me. Show Mr. Stanton where the cigars are.”
 
 They were not in good humour when they left her.
 
 “I don’t smoke cigars,” Gabriel said abruptly when Dr. Kennedy made a
 feint of carrying out her wishes. Peter shrugged his shoulders.
 
 “She told me to find them for you.”
 
 “Has she had attacks like this before?” Gabriel asked, after a pause.
 Peter answered gloomily:
 
 “And will again if she is allowed to overtire herself by driving for
 hours in the sun, and then encouraged to sit through a long dinner,
 talking all the time.”
 
 “She ought not to have played?” Peter Kennedy threw himself on to the
 sofa, desecrating it, bringing an angry flush to Gabriel’s brow. But
 when he groaned and said:
 
 “If one could only do anything for her!”
 
 Gabriel forgave him in that instant. Gabriel had lived all his life with
 an invalid. Attacks of hysteria and faintness had been his daily menu
 for years.
 
 “But surely an attack of faintness is not very unusual or alarming? My
 sister often faints....”
 
 “She isn’t Margaret Capel, is she?”
 
 “You ... you knew Mrs. Capel before she came to Carbies?”
 
 “No, I didn’t. But I know her now, don’t I?”
 
 Gabriel was silent. He had seen a great many doctors too, before the
 Christian Scientists had broken their influence, but such a one as this
 was new to him. Margaret was so sacred and special to him that he did
 not know what to think. But Peter gave him little time for thinking. He
",Twilight
33," madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as
 I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own
 reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put
 to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay
 before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
 matter.”
 
 “Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies
 in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so
 entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that
 even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and
 advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a
 nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing
 answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can
 see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may
 advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”
 
 “I am all attention, madam.”
 
 “My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my step-father, who is
 the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the
 Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”
 
 Holmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.
 
 “The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the
 estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and
 Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive
 heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family
 ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the
 Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the
 two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy
 mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living
 the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my
 step-father, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,
 obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a
 medical degree, and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional
 skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.
 In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been
 perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death, and
 narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long
 term of imprisonment, and afterwards returned to England a morose and
 disappointed man.
 
 “When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the
 young widow of Major-general Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister
 Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of
 my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less
 than £1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely
 while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum
 should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly
 after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years
 ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his
 attempts to establish himself in practice in London, and took us to
 live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money
 which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed
 to be no obstacle to our happiness.
 
 “But a terrible change came over our step-father about this time.
 Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who
 had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in
 the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came
 out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his
 path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in
 the men of the family, and in my step-father’s case it had, I believe,
 been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
 disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,
 until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks
 would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and
 absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
 
 “Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,
 and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather
 together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no
 friends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these
 vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land
 which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the
 hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for
 weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent
 over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and
 a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds, and are feared by the
 villagers almost as much as their master.
 
 “You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no
 great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a
 long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the
 time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even
 as mine has.”
 
 “Your sister is dead, then?”
 
 “She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to
 speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have
 described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and
 position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss
 Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally
 allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at
 Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines,
 to whom she became engaged. My step-father learned of the engagement
 when my sister returned, and offered no objection to the marriage; but
 within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the
 terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed
 and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and
 glanced across at his visitor.
 
 “Pray be precise as to details,” said he.
 
 “It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is
 seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very
 old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are
 on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of
 the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second
 my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between
 them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself
 plain?”
 
 “Perfectly so.”
 
 “The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal
 night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he
 had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of
 the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left
 her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,
 chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to
 leave me but she paused at the door and looked back.
 
 “‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard any one whistle in
 the dead of the night?’
 
 “‘Never,’ said I.
 
 “‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your
 sleep?’
 
 “‘Certainly not. But why?’
 
 “‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in
 the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it
 has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the
 next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you
 whether you had heard it.’
 
 “‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.’
 
 “‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did
 not hear it also.’
 
 “‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’
 
 “‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at
 me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the
 lock.”
 
 “Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in
 at night?”
 
 “Always.”
 
 “And why?”
 
 “I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a
 baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”
 
 “Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”
 
 “I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune
 impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you
 know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely
 allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain
 was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the
 hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified
 woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,
 wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my
 door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a
 few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.
 As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved
 slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing
 what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I
 saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her
 hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that
 of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
 moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She
 writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully
 convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognized me, but as I
 bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never
 forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There
 was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with
 her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s room, but a
 fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling
 loudly for my step-father, and I met him hastening from his room in his
 dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,
 and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid
 from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and
 died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful
 end of my beloved sister.”
 
 “One moment,” said Holmes; “are you sure about this whistle and
 metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”
 
 “That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my
 strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale
 and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”
 
 “Was your sister dressed?”
 
 “No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
 charred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.”
 
 “Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the
 alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the
 coroner come to?”
 
 “He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct
 had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any
 satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had
 been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by
 old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every
 night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite
 solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with
 the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large
 staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when
 she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”
 
 “How about poison?”
 
 “The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”
 
 “What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”
 
 “It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though
 what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”
 
 “Were there gypsies in the plantation at the time?”
 
 “Yes, there are nearly always some there.”
 
 “Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled
 band?”
 
 “Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,
 sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to
 these very gypsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted
 handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have
 suggested the strange adjective which she used.”
 
 Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
 
 “These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.”
 
 “Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately
 lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have
 known for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage.
 His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage,
 of Crane Water, near Reading. My step-father has offered no opposition
 to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two
 days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building,
 and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into
 the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in
 which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night,
 as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in
 the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of
 her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be
 seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I
 dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart
 at the ‘Crown Inn,’ which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from
 whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you
 and asking your advice.”
 
 “You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”
 
 “Yes, all.”
 
 “Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your step-father.”
 
 “Why, what do you mean?”
 
 For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the
 hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the
 marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.
 
 “You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.
 
 The lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a
 hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”
 
 There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his
 hands and stared into the crackling fire.
 
 “This is a very deep business,” he said, at last. “There are a thousand
 details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course
 of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to
 Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms
 without the knowledge of your step-father?”
 
 “As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most
 important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and
 that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a house-keeper
 now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the
 way.”
 
 “Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”
 
 “By no means.”
 
 “Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”
 
 “I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in
 town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there
 in time for your coming.”
 
 “And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small
 business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”
 
 “No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided
 my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this
 afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided
 from the room.
 
 “And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,
 leaning back in his chair.
 
 “It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”
 
 “Dark enough and sinister enough.”
 
 “Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are
 sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her
 sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious
 end.”
 
 “What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very
 peculiar words of the dying woman?”
 
 “I cannot think.”
 
 “When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a
 band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the
 fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an
 interest in preventing his step-daughter’s marriage, the dying allusion
 to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a
 metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars
 which secured the shutters falling back into their place, I think that
 there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along
 those lines.”
 
 “But what, then, did the gypsies do?”
 
 “I cannot imagine.”
 
 “I see many objections to any such theory.”
 
 “And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to
 Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,
 or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”
 
 The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our
 door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed
 himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the
 professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long
 frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in
 his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar
 of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to
 side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with
 the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the
 other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
 fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird
 of prey.
 
 “Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.
 
 “My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion,
 quietly.
 
 “I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”
 
 “Indeed, doctor,” said Holmes, blandly. “Pray take a seat.”
 
 “I will do nothing of the kind. My step-daughter has been here. I have
 traced her. What has she been saying to you?”
 
 “It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.
 
 “What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man, furiously.
 
 “But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my
 companion, imperturbably.
 
 “Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step
 forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I
 have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”
 
 My friend smiled.
 
 “Holmes, the busybody!”
 
 His smile broadened.
 
 “Holmes, the Scotland-yard Jack-in-office!”
 
 Holmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”
 said he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided
 draught.”
 
 “I will go when I have said my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my
 affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a
 dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,
 seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
 
 “See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling
 the twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room.
 
 “He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not
 quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my
 grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up
 the steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.
 
 “Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
 detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
 however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from
 her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson,
 we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’
 Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this
 matter.”
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 It was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his
 excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over
 with notes and figures.
 
 “I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine
 its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices
 of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which
 at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £1100, is now,
 through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £750. Each
 daughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage. It is
 evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would
 have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to
 a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it
 has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the
 way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for
 dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting
 ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and
 drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your
 revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument
 with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a
 tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”
 
 At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,
 where we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five
 miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with
 a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and
 way-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and
 the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at
 least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the
 spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion
 sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over
 his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest
 thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and
 pointed over the meadows.
 
 “Look there!” said he.
 
 A heavily-timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into
 a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out
 the gray gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.
 
 “Stoke Moran?” said he.
 
 “Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the
 driver.
 
 “There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we
 are going.”
 
 “There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs
 some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll
 find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over
 the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”
 
 “And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his
 eyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”
 
 We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to
 Leatherhead.
 
 “I thought it as well,” said Holmes, as we climbed the stile, “that
 this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some
 definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.
 You see that we have been as good as our word.”
 
 Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face
 which spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she
 cried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly.
 Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back
 before evening.”
 
 “We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said
 Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss
 Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
 
 “Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”
 
 “So it appears.”
 
 “He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will
 he say when he returns?”
 
 “He must guard himself, for he may find that there is some one more
 cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him
 to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at
 Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us
 at once to the rooms which we are to examine.”
 
 The building was of gray, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central
 portion, and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out
 on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken, and
 blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a
 picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but
 the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the
 windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that
 this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected
 against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but
 there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes
 walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep
 attention the outsides of the windows.
 
 “This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the
 centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to
 Dr. Roylott’s chamber?”
 
 “Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”
 
 “Pending the alterations, as I understand. By-the-way, there does not
 seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”
 
 “There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my
 room.”
 
 “Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing
 runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows
 in it, of course?”
 
 “Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for any one to pass through.”
 
 “As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable
 from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room
 and bar your shutters.”
 
 Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through
 the open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open,
 but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be
 passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but
 they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”
 said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; “my theory certainly
 presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they
 were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the
 matter.”
 
 A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the
 three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber,
 so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now
 sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a
 homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after
 the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood
 in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a
 dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,
 with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the
 room, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards
 round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so
 old and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of
 the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,
 while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in
 every detail of the apartment.
 
 “Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked, at last, pointing to
 a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually
 lying upon the pillow.
 
 “It goes to the house-keeper’s room.”
 
 “It looks newer than the other things?”
 
 “Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”
 
 “Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”
 
 “No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we
 wanted for ourselves.”
 
 “Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You
 will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this
 floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand,
 and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks
 between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which
 the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed, and spent
 some time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the
 wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
 
 “Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.
 
 “Won’t it ring?”
 
 “No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You
 can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little
 opening for the ventilator is.”
 
 “How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”
 
 “Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or
 two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a
 builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the
 same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”
 
 “That is also quite modern,” said the lady.
 
 “Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.
 
 “Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”
 
 “They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy
 bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your
 permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the
 inner apartment.”
 
",Holmes
34," subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature
 consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that
 the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the
 former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the
 great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.
 
 Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care
 of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. If fervent
 prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in
 heaven—and if they be not, what prayers are!—the blessings which the
 orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing
 peace and happiness.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXII.
 OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS
 
 
 Oliver’s ailings were neither slight nor few. In addition to the pain
 and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold
 had brought on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and
 reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get
 better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how
 deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently
 he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something
 to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the
 love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however
 slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not
 been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued
 from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and
 soul.
 
 “Poor fellow!” said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly
 endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale
 lips; “you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. We
 are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall
 accompany us. The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and
 beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days. We will employ you
 in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.”
 
 “The trouble!” cried Oliver. “Oh! dear lady, if I could but work for
 you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or
 watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make
 you happy; what would I give to do it!”
 
 “You shall give nothing at all,” said Miss Maylie, smiling; “for, as I
 told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only
 take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make
 me very happy indeed.”
 
 “Happy, ma’am!” cried Oliver; “how kind of you to say so!”
 
 “You will make me happier than I can tell you,” replied the young lady.
 “To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing
 any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an
 unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness
 and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence,
 would delight me, more than you can well imagine. Do you understand
 me?” she inquired, watching Oliver’s thoughtful face.
 
 “Oh yes, ma’am, yes!” replied Oliver eagerly; “but I was thinking that
 I am ungrateful now.”
 
 “To whom?” inquired the young lady.
 
 “To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care
 of me before,” rejoined Oliver. “If they knew how happy I am, they
 would be pleased, I am sure.”
 
 “I am sure they would,” rejoined Oliver’s benefactress; “and Mr.
 Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well
 enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.”
 
 “Has he, ma’am?” cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure. “I
 don’t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once
 again!”
 
 In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the
 fatigue of this expedition. One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out,
 accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. When
 they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a
 loud exclamation.
 
 “What’s the matter with the boy?” cried the doctor, as usual, all in a
 bustle. “Do you see anything—hear anything—feel anything—eh?”
 
 “That, sir,” cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. “That
 house!”
 
 “Yes; well, what of it? Stop coachman. Pull up here,” cried the doctor.
 “What of the house, my man; eh?”
 
 “The thieves—the house they took me to!” whispered Oliver.
 
 “The devil it is!” cried the doctor. “Hallo, there! let me out!”
 
 But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled
 out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the
 deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.
 
 “Halloa?” said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so
 suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick,
 nearly fell forward into the passage. “What’s the matter here?”
 
 “Matter!” exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment’s
 reflection. “A good deal. Robbery is the matter.”
 
 “There’ll be Murder the matter, too,” replied the hump-backed man,
 coolly, “if you don’t take your hands off. Do you hear me?”
 
 “I hear you,” said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.
 
 “Where’s—confound the fellow, what’s his rascally name—Sikes; that’s
 it. Where’s Sikes, you thief?”
 
 The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and
 indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor’s
 grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the
 house. Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed
 into the parlour, without a word of parley.
 
 He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige
 of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the
 cupboards; answered Oliver’s description!
 
 “Now!” said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, “what do
 you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to
 rob me, or to murder me? Which is it?”
 
 “Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair,
 you ridiculous old vampire?” said the irritable doctor.
 
 “What do you want, then?” demanded the hunchback. “Will you take
 yourself off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!”
 
 “As soon as I think proper,” said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other
 parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to
 Oliver’s account of it. “I shall find you out, some day, my friend.”
 
 “Will you?” sneered the ill-favoured cripple. “If you ever want me, I’m
 here. I haven’t lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty
 years, to be scared by you. You shall pay for this; you shall pay for
 this.” And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and
 danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.
 
 “Stupid enough, this,” muttered the doctor to himself; “the boy must
 have made a mistake. Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself
 up again.” With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money,
 and returned to the carriage.
 
 The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations
 and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the
 driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant
 with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and
 vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months
 afterwards. He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until
 the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their
 way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the
 ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.
 
 “I am an ass!” said the doctor, after a long silence. “Did you know
 that before, Oliver?”
 
 “No, sir.”
 
 “Then don’t forget it another time.”
 
 “An ass,” said the doctor again, after a further silence of some
 minutes. “Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows
 had been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had
 assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my
 own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I
 have hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though.
 I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on
 impulse. It might have done me good.”
 
 Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon
 anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment
 to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from
 being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the
 warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him. If the truth must be
 told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being
 disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver’s story on
 the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any. He
 soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver’s replies to
 his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still
 delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever
 been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that
 time forth.
 
 As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided,
 they were enabled to drive straight thither. When the coach turned into
 it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his
 breath.
 
 “Now, my boy, which house is it?” inquired Mr. Losberne.
 
 “That! That!” replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. “The
 white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should
 die: it makes me tremble so.”
 
 “Come, come!” said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. “You
 will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and
 well.”
 
 “Oh! I hope so!” cried Oliver. “They were so good to me; so very, very
 good to me.”
 
 The coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next
 door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at
 the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.
 
 Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window.
 “To Let.”
 
 “Knock at the next door,” cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver’s arm in
 his. “What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the
 adjoining house, do you know?”
 
 The servant did not know; but would go and inquire. She presently
 returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone
 to the West Indies, six weeks before. Oliver clasped his hands, and
 sank feebly backward.
 
 “Has his housekeeper gone too?” inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment’s
 pause.
 
 “Yes, sir”; replied the servant. “The old gentleman, the housekeeper,
 and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow’s, all went together.”
 
 “Then turn towards home again,” said Mr. Losberne to the driver; “and
 don’t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded
 London!”
 
 “The book-stall keeper, sir?” said Oliver. “I know the way there. See
 him, pray, sir! Do see him!”
 
 “My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,” said the
 doctor. “Quite enough for both of us. If we go to the book-stall
 keeper’s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house
 on fire, or run away. No; home again straight!” And in obedience to the
 doctor’s impulse, home they went.
 
 This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in
 the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times
 during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs.
 Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how
 many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had
 done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope
 of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he
 had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many
 of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so
 far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a
 robber—a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day—was
 almost more than he could bear.
 
 The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of
 his benefactors. After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather
 had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young
 leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house
 at Chertsey, for some months.
 
 Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin’s cupidity, to the
 banker’s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,
 they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took
 Oliver with them.
 
 Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft
 tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green
 hills and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of
 peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close
 and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded
 hearts! Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives
 of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has
 indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick
 and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even
 they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at
 last for one short glimpse of Nature’s face; and, carried far from the
 scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once
 into a new state of being. Crawling forth, from day to day, to some
 green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by
 the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a
 foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they
 have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they
 watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded
 from their dim and feeble sight! The memories which peaceful country
 scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes.
 Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the
 graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before
 it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the
 least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having
 held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which
 calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride
 and worldliness beneath it.
 
 It was a lovely spot to which they repaired. Oliver, whose days had
 been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and
 brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there. The rose and
 honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks
 of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious
 odours. Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall
 unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh
 turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at
 rest. Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave
 in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen;
 but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease
 to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly,
 but without pain.
 
 It was a happy time. The days were peaceful and serene; the nights
 brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched
 prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and
 happy thoughts. Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman,
 who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to
 write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could
 never try enough to please him. Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie
 and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in
 some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could
 have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his
 own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work
 hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came
 slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them:
 listening with such pleasure to all they said: and so happy if they
 wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything
 he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it.
 When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would
 sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low
 and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear.
 There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver
 would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a
 perfect rapture.
 
 And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way
 in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the
 other days in that most happy time! There was the little church, in the
 morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds
 singing without: and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low
 porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor
 people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that
 it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there
 together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and
 sounded more musical (to Oliver’s ears at least) than any he had ever
 heard in church before. Then, there were the walks as usual, and many
 calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver
 read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all
 the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and
 pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.
 
 In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o’clock, roaming the
 fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild
 flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took
 great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the
 embellishment of the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too,
 for Miss Maylie’s birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the
 subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the
 cages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce
 and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of
 charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare
 cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was
 always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which
 Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who
 was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until
 Miss Rose made her appearance: when there were a thousand commendations
 to be bestowed on all he had done.
 
 So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the
 most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled
 happiness, and which, in Oliver’s were true felicity. With the purest
 and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest,
 soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of
 that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with
 the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his
 young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment
 to, himself.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXIII.
 WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN
 CHECK
 
 
 Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been
 beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its
 richness. The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the
 earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and
 stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted
 open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant
 shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine,
 which lay stretched beyond. The earth had donned her mantle of
 brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad. It was the prime
 and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.
 
 Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same
 cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. Oliver had long since
 grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in
 his warm feelings of a great many people. He was still the same gentle,
 attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and
 suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every
 slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.
 
 One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was
 customary with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was
 a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually
 refreshing. Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on,
 in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary
 bounds. Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home. The
 young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano
 as usual. After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes,
 she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they
 heard a sound as if she were weeping.
 
 “Rose, my dear!” said the elder lady.
 
 Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words
 had roused her from some painful thoughts.
 
 “Rose, my love!” cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over
 her. “What is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses you?”
 
 “Nothing, aunt; nothing,” replied the young lady. “I don’t know what it
 is; I can’t describe it; but I feel—”
 
 “Not ill, my love?” interposed Mrs. Maylie.
 
 “No, no! Oh, not ill!” replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly
 chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; “I shall be better
 presently. Close the window, pray!”
 
 Oliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an
 effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune;
 but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with
 her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she
 was now unable to repress.
 
 “My child!” said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, “I never
 saw you so before.”
 
 “I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,” rejoined Rose; “but indeed
 I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.”
 
 She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the
 very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of
 her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had
 lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an
 anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn
 before. Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a
 heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye. Again this disappeared,
 like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly
 pale.
 
 Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was
 alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that
 she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and
 they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to
 retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in
 better health: assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in
 the morning, quite well.
 
 “I hope,” said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, “that nothing is the
 matter? She don’t look well to-night, but—”
 
 The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in
 a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length,
 she said, in a trembling voice:
 
 “I hope not, Oliver. I have been very happy with her for some years:
 too happy, perhaps. It may be time that I should meet with some
 misfortune; but I hope it is not this.”
 
 “What?” inquired Oliver.
 
 “The heavy blow,” said the old lady, “of losing the dear girl who has
 so long been my comfort and happiness.”
 
 “Oh! God forbid!” exclaimed Oliver, hastily.
 
 “Amen to that, my child!” said the old lady, wringing her hands.
 
 “Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?” said Oliver. “Two
 hours ago, she was quite well.”
 
 “She is very ill now,” rejoined Mrs. Maylies; “and will be worse, I am
 sure. My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her!”
 
 She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own
 emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that,
 for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.
 
 “And consider, ma’am,” said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into
 his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. “Oh! consider how
 young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all
 about her. I am sure—certain—quite certain—that, for your sake, who are
 so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so
 happy; she will not die. Heaven will never let her die so young.”
 
 “Hush!” said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver’s head. “You think
 like a child, poor boy. But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. I
 had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned,
 for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the
 agony of separation from the objects of our love. I have seen enough,
 too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared
 to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow;
 for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there
 is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.
 God’s will be done! I love her; and He knows how well!”
 
 Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she
 checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself
 up as she spoke, became composed and firm. He was still more astonished
 to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and
 watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected:
 performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and,
 to all external appearances, even cheerfully. But he was young, and did
 not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances.
 How should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves?
 
 An anxious night ensued. When morning came, Mrs. Maylie’s predictions
 were but too well verified. Rose was in the first stage of a high and
 dangerous fever.
 
 “We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,” said
 Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into
 his face; “this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to
 Mr. Losberne. It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more
 than four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence
 dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The
 people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to
 see it done, I know.”
 
 Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.
 
 “Here is another letter,” said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; “but
 whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I
 scarcely know. I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.”
 
 “Is it for Chertsey, too, ma’am?” inquired Oliver; impatient to execute
 his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.
 
 “No,” replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver
 glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire,
 at some great lord’s house in the country; where, he could not make
 out.
 
 “Shall it go, ma’am?” asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.
 
 “I think not,” replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. “I will wait until
 to-morrow.”
 
 With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off,
 without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.
 
 Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which
 sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either
 side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers
 were busy at their work: nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a
 few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and
 covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.
 
 Here he paused, and looked about for the inn. There were a white bank,
 and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was
 a large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which
 was the sign of “The George.” To this he hastened, as soon as it caught
 his eye.
 
 He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after
 hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing
 all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall
 gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots
 with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking
 his teeth with a silver toothpick.
 
 This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out
 the bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready,
 and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which
 took up ten good minutes more. Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate
 state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have
 jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the
 next stage. At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been
 handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy
 delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven
 paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along
 the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.
 
 As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and
 that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a
 somewhat lighter heart. He was turning out of the gateway when he
 accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at
 that moment coming out of the inn door.
 
 “Hah!” cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly
 recoiling. “What the devil’s this?”
 
 “I beg your pardon, sir,” said Oliver; “I was in a great hurry to get
 home, and didn’t see you were coming.”
 
 “Death!” muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large
 dark eyes. “Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He’d start
 up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!”
 
 “I am sorry,” stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man’s wild
 look. “I hope I have not hurt you!”
 
 “Rot you!” murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his
 clenched teeth; “if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might
 have been free of you in a night. Curses on your head, and black death
 on your heart, you imp! What are you doing here?”
 
 The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He
 advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at
 him, but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.
 
 Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he
 supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help. Having
 seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards,
 running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling
 with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary
 behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.
 
 The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for
 when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and
 to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.
 
 Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was
 delirious. A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in
 constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he
 had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a
 most alarming nature. “In fact,” he said, “it would be little short of
 a miracle, if she recovered.”
 
 How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out,
 with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest
 sound from the sick chamber! How often did a tremble shake his frame,
 and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling
 of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had
 even then occurred! And what had been the fervency of all the prayers
 he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the
 agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the
 gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave’s verge!
 
 Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by
 while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! Oh!
 the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat
 violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they
 conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to
 relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to
 alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of
 our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what
 reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time,
 allay them!
 
 Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke
 in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time;
 women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for
 hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the
 garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and
 shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay
 stretched inside. Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived. “It is hard,”
 said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; “so young; so much
 beloved; but there is very little hope.”
 
 Another morning. The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked
 upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom
 about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy,
 surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting
 fast. Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one
 of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.
 
 There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and
 mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the
 summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering
 overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy
 raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively
 occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could
 surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that
 graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and
 fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and
 shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in
 their ghastly folds.
 
 A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.
 Another! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of
 humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse
 was young. They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother—a
 mother once—among the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and
 the birds sang on.
 
 Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received
 from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that
 he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was. He
 had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of
 thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred
 little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have
 been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been. We need be
 careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to
 some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so
 little done—of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might
 have been repaired! There is no remorse so deep as that which is
 unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this,
 in time.
 
 When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.
 Oliver’s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside
 of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven
 her away. He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which
 she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell,
 and die.
 
 They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted meal
 was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were
 elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at
 length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his
 departure. Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching
 footstep. They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne
 entered.
 
 “What of Rose?” cried the old lady. “Tell me at once! I can bear it;
 anything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!”
 
 “You must compose yourself,” said the doctor supporting her. “Be calm,
 my dear ma’am, pray.”
 
 “Let me go, in God’s name! My dear child! She is dead! She is dying!”
 
 “No!” cried the doctor, passionately. “As He is good and merciful, she
 will live to bless us all, for years to come.”
 
 The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but
 the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her
 first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were
 extended to receive her.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXIV.
 CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN
 WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO
 OLIVER
 
 
 It was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and
 stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak,
 or rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had
 passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of
 tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a
 full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost
 insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.
 
 The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with
 flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of
 the sick chamber. As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind
 him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace. Looking
 round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as
 the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning
 against a gate until it should have passed him.
 
 As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap,
 whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that
 he could not identify the person. In another second or two, the
 nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice
 bellowed to the driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull
 up his horses. Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same
 voice called Oliver by his name.
 
 “Here!” cried the voice. “Oliver, what’s the news? Miss Rose! Master
 O-li-ver!”
 
 “Is it you, Giles?” cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.
 
 Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply,
 when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the
 other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.
 
 “In a word!” cried the gentleman, “Better or worse?”
 
 “Better—much better!” replied Oliver, hastily.
 
 “Thank Heaven!” exclaimed the gentleman. “You are sure?”
 
 “Quite, sir,” replied Oliver. “The change took place only a few hours
 ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.”
 
 The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door,
 leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.
 
 “You are quite certain? There is no possibility of any mistake on your
 part, my boy, is there?” demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.
 “Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.”
 
 “I would not for the world, sir,” replied Oliver. “Indeed you may
 believe me. Mr. Losberne’s words were, that she would live to bless us
 all for many years to come. I heard him say so.”
 
 The tears stood in Oliver’s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the
 beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away,
 and remained silent, for some minutes. Oliver thought he heard him sob,
 more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark—for
 he could well guess what his feelings were—and so stood apart, feigning
 to be occupied with his nosegay.
 
 All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting
 on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and
 wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with
 white spots. That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was
 abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the
 young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.
 
 “I think you had better go on to my mother’s in the chaise, Giles,”
 said he. “I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time
 before I see her. You can say I am coming.”
 
 “I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,” said Giles: giving a final polish to
 his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; “but if you would leave
 the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. It
 wouldn’t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should
 never have any more authority with them if they did.”
 
 “Well,” rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, “you can do as you like. Let
 him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us.
 Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering,
 or we shall be taken for madmen.”
 
 Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and
 pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape,
 which he took out of the chaise. This done, the postboy drove off;
 Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.
 
 As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much
 interest and curiosity at the new comer. He seemed about
 five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his
 countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and
 prepossessing. Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he
 bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had
 no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not
 already spoken of her as his mother.
 
 Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached
 the cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on
 both sides.
 
 “Mother!” whispered the young man; “why did you not write before?”
 
 “I did,” replied Mrs. Maylie; “but, on reflection, I determined to keep
 back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne’s opinion.”
 
 “But why,” said the young man, “why run the chance of that occurring
 which so nearly happened? If Rose had—I cannot utter that word now—if
 this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have
 forgiven yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!”
 
 “If that _had_ been the case, Harry,” said Mrs. Maylie, “I fear your
 happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival
 here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little
 import.”
 
 “And who can wonder if it be so, mother?” rejoined the young man; “or
 why should I say, _if_?—It is—it is—you know it, mother—you must know
 it!”
 
 “I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can
 offer,” said Mrs. Maylie; “I know that the devotion and affection of
 her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and
 lasting. If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed
 behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my
 task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many
 struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the
 strict line of duty.”
 
 “This is unkind, mother,” said Harry. “Do you still suppose that I am a
 boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own
 soul?”
 
 “I think, my dear son,” returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his
 shoulder, “that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and
 that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more
 fleeting. Above all, I think” said the lady, fixing her eyes on her
 son’s face, “that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a
 wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no
 fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and
 upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the
 world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against
 him: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent
 of the connection he formed in early life. And she may have the pain of
 knowing that he does so.”
 
 “Mother,” said the young man, impatiently, “he would be a selfish
 brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe,
 who acted thus.”
 
 “You think so now, Harry,” replied his mother.
 
 “And ever will!” said the young man. “The mental agony I have suffered,
 during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion
 which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have
 lightly formed. On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly
 as ever heart of man was set on woman. I have no thought, no view, no
 hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you
 take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.
 Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the
 happiness of which you seem to think so little.”
 
 “Harry,” said Mrs. Maylie, “it is because I think so much of warm and
 sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we
 have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.”
 
 “Let it rest with Rose, then,” interposed Harry. “You will not press
 these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle
 in my way?”
 
 “I will not,” rejoined Mrs. Maylie; “but I would have you consider—”
 
 “I _have_ considered!” was the impatient reply; “Mother, I have
 considered, years and years. I have considered, ever since I have been
 capable of serious reflection. My feelings remain unchanged, as they
 ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them
 vent, which can be productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave
 this place, Rose shall hear me.”
 
 “She shall,” said Mrs. Maylie.
 
 “There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she
 will hear me coldly, mother,” said the young man.
 
 “Not coldly,” rejoined the old lady; “far from it.”
 
 “How then?” urged the young man. “She has formed no other attachment?”
 
 “No, indeed,” replied his mother; “you have, or I mistake, too strong a
 hold on her affections already. What I would say,” resumed the old
 lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, “is this. Before you
 stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried
 to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child,
 on Rose’s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her
 doubtful birth may have on her decision: devoted as she is to us, with
 all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of
 self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her
 characteristic.”
 
 “What do you mean?”
 
 “That I leave you to discover,” replied Mrs. Maylie. “I must go back to
 her. God bless you!”
 
 “I shall see you again to-night?” said the young man, eagerly.
 
 “By and by,” replied the lady; “when I leave Rose.”
 
 “You will tell her I am here?” said Harry.
",OliverTwist
35," because I could kiss the ground she walks on, because I’d give my life
 for hers any day?” Gabriel’s face might have been carved. “She treats me
 like a dog....”
 
 Gabriel made a gesture of dissent, Margaret could not treat any one like
 a dog.
 
 “Oh, yes, she does, she says I’m not fit to wipe the mud off your
 shoes....”
 
 Then Margaret knew. He was a little stunned and taken by surprise to
 think Margaret knew her doctor was in love with her, knew and had kept
 him in attendance. But of course she was right, everything she did was
 right. She had not taken the matter seriously.
 
 “I suppose I’d better go.” Peter dropped his feet to the ground, rose
 slowly. “She won’t see me again if she says she won’t. She’s got her
 bromide. You might ring me up in the morning and tell me how she is, if
 she wants me to come round. That’s not too much to ask, is it?” he said
 savagely.
 
 “Not at all,” Gabriel answered coldly. “I should of course do anything
 she wished.” Peter paused a moment at the door.
 
 “I say, you’re not going to try and put her off me, are you? Just
 because I’ve let myself go to you?”
 
 “I am not authorised to interfere in Mrs. Capel’s affairs.” Gabriel was
 quite himself again and very stiff.
 
 “But I understand you will be.”
 
 “I would rather not discuss the future with you.”
 
 “Then you do intend to try and out me?”
 
 Gabriel was suddenly a little sorry for him, he looked so desperately
 miserable and anxious, and after all he, Peter Kennedy, was leaving the
 house. Gabriel was remaining, sleeping under the same roof.
 
 “I will see her maid if possible. You shall be called up if you are
 needed. Nothing but her well-being, her own wish will be thought of....
 Anyway you shall have a report.”
 
 “As her doctor she trusts me. I can ease her symptoms.” It was almost a
 plea. “She need not suffer.”
 
 “Of course you will be sent for. They have your telephone number?”
 
 Peter held out his hand.
 
 “Good-night. You’re a good fellow. She is quite right. I suppose I ought
 not to have told you how it is with me...?”
 
 “It is of no consequence,” Gabriel answered, intending to be courteous.
 
 
 
 
                                CHAPTER XI
 
 
 Sunday morning the church bells were chiming against the blue sky in the
 clear air. Both invalids were better. The reports Gabriel received
 whilst he sat over his solitary breakfast were to the effect that Miss
 Stanton had slept well and was without headache, she sent word also of
 her intention to go to church if it were possible. Stevens herself told
 him that Mrs. Capel would be coming down at eleven o’clock or half-past,
 having had an excellent night. He was not to stay in for her.
 
 “Can you tell me how far off is the nearest church?”
 
 Stevens was fully informed on the matter. There were two almost within
 equal distance.
 
 “Not more than a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes away. The nearest
 is the ’ighest....” Stevens was a typical English maid, secretly devoted
 to her mistress, well up in her duties but with a perpetual grievance or
 list of grievances. “Not that I get there myself, not on Sunday
 mornings, since I’ve been here.”
 
 Gabriel was sympathetic. Contempt, however, was thrown upon his
 suggestion of the afternoon.
 
 “Children’s services and such-like, no thank you!”
 
 As for the evenings Stevens said “they was mostly hymns.” He detained
 her for a few minutes, for was she not Margaret’s confidential maid,
 compensating her, too, for her lack of religious privileges. He told her
 to tell her mistress he would walk to church with his sister and then
 return, that he looked forward to seeing her if she were really better.
 Otherwise she was not to think of rising.
 
 “She’ll get up right enough. I’m to have her bath ready at ’alf-past
 ten.”
 
 When Anne came down he walked with her over the common-land, bright with
 gorse and broom that lay between Carbies and the higher of the two
 churches, heard how Anne had lain awake and then how she had slept, sure
 of the intervention of Mrs. Roope. Her headache had completely
 disappeared.
 
 “You did send that telegram, didn’t you?”
 
 Gabriel assured her that the telegram had been duly despatched.
 
 “She must have started on me at once. She is a good creature. I wish you
 were more sympathetic to it. You’ve never once been with me to a
 meeting.”
 
 “But I have not put anything in the way of your going.”
 
 “Oh, yes! I know how good you are. Which reminds me, Gabriel, about Mrs.
 Capel. We must talk things over when we get home. You must not do
 anything in a hurry. I heard about her fainting away last night. It is
 not only that she is a widow, and terribly delicate, her maid tells me,
 but she takes no care of herself, none at all.... What a rate you are
 walking at; I’m sure we have plenty of time, the bells are still going.
 I can’t keep up with you.” He slowed down. “As I was saying, I shouldn’t
 like you to be more particular with her until we have talked things over
 together. Of course as far as her delicacy is concerned, we might
 persuade her to see Mrs. Roope.”
 
 “I have already asked Mrs. Capel if she will do me the honour of
 becoming my wife,” her brother said in a tone she found curious,
 peculiar, not at all like himself.
 
 “Oh, dear! how tiresome! You really are so impulsive. Of course I like
 her very much, very much indeed, but there are so many things to be
 thought of. How long has her husband been dead? You know she is more
 than half an American, she told me so herself, and such strange things
 do happen with American husbands.”
 
 “Mrs. Capel divorced her husband!” He spoke quickly, abruptly, hurrying
 her on toward the church, through the gate and up the path where a
 little stream of people was already before them, people carrying
 prayer-books, or holding by the hand a stiffly dressed unwilling child;
 one or two women with elderly husbands.
 
 Anne gave a little subdued scream when Gabriel told her that Mrs. Capel
 had divorced her husband, a little gasp.
 
 “Oh dear, oh dear!” It was impossible to say more under the
 circumstances, she could not make a scene here.
 
 “You will be able to find your way back all right?” he asked her. The
 bells were clashing now almost above their heads, clashing slowly to the
 finish.
 
 “I’m sure I don’t know whether I am standing on my head or my heels.”
 
 “You will be all right when you are inside.”
 
 “I haven’t even got my smelling-salts with me, I promised to leave off
 carrying them.” She was almost crying with agitation.
 
 “You will be all right,” he said again. He waited until she had gone
 through the door, the little bent figure in its new coat and skirt and
 Victorian hat tied under the chin. Then he was free to return on swift
 feet to Carbies to await Margaret’s coming. He walked so swiftly that
 although it had taken them twenty minutes to get there he was barely ten
 in coming back. He hurried faster when he saw there was a figure at the
 gate.
 
 “It is too fine to be indoors this morning. I am going down to the sea.
 I yearn for the sea this morning. Go up to the house, will you? Fetch a
 cushion or so. Then we can be luxurious.” He executed his commission
 quickly, and when he came up to her again had not only a cushion but a
 rug on his arm. She said quickly:
 
 “What a wonderful morning! Isn’t it a God-given morning?”
 
 “All mornings are wonderful and God-given that bring me to you,” he
 answered little less soberly, walking by her side. “Won’t you lean a
 little on me, take my arm?”
 
 “Do I look decrepit?” She laughed, walking on light feet. Spring was
 everywhere, in the soft air, and the throats of courting birds, in the
 breeze and both their hearts. They went down to the sea and he arranged
 the cushions against that very rock behind which I had once sat and
 heard them talk. She said now she must face the sea, the winds that blew
 from it.
 
 “Not too cold?” he asked her.
 
 “Not too anything. You may sit on the rug too, there is a bit to spare
 for you. What book have you in your pocket?”
 
 “No book today. I carried Anne’s prayer-book.”
 
 “‘Science and Health’?”
 
 She was full of merriment and laughter.
 
 “No; the ordinary Church Service. There was nothing else available.”
 
 “Oh, yes, there was. I sent for a copy of Mrs. Eddy’s lucubrations.”
 
 “No!”
 
 “Of course I did. I had to make myself acquainted with a subject on
 which I should be compelled to talk.”
 
 “What a wonderful woman you are.”
 
 “Not at all. If she had been a South Sea Islander I’d have welcomed her
 with shells or beads. Tell me, have I made a success? Will she give her
 consent?”
 
 “Have you given yours, have you really given yours? You have never said
 so in so many words.”
 
 “Well, the implication must have been fairly obvious.” The eyes she
 turned on him were full of happy laughter, almost girlish. Since
 yesterday she had had this new strange bloom of youth. “Don’t tell me
 your sister has not guessed.”
 
 “I told her.”
 
 “You told her! Well! I never! as Stevens would say. And you were
 pretending not to know!”
 
 “I only said you had never put it into words. Say it now, Margaret, out
 here, this wonderful Sunday.”
 
 “What am I to say?”
 
 “Put your little hand in mine, your sweet flower of a hand.” He took it.
 
 “Not a flower, a weed. See how brown they have got since I’ve been
 here.” He kissed the weed or flower of her hand.
 
 “Say, ‘Gabriel, you shall be my husband. I will marry you the very first
 day I am free!’” Her brows knitted, she took her hand away a little
 pettishly.
 
 “I _am_ free. Why do you remind me?”
 
 “Say, ‘I will marry you on the last day in May, in six weeks from
 today.’”
 
 “May marriages are unlucky.”
 
 “Ours could not be.”
 
 “Oh, yes! it could. I am a woman of moods.”
 
 “Every one more lovely than the last.”
 
 “Impatient and irritable.”
 
 “You shall have no time to be impatient. Anything you want I will rush
 to obtain for you. If you are irritable I will soothe you.”
 
 “And then I want hours to myself.”
 
 “I’ll wait outside your door, on the mat, to keep interruptions from
 you.”
 
 “I want to write ... to play the piano, to rest a great deal.”
 
 “Give me your odd half-hours.” She gave him back her hand instead.
 
 “Let’s pretend. We are to sail away into the unknown; to be happy ever
 afterwards. Where shall we go, Gabriel? Can we have a yacht?”
 
 “I am not rich.”
 
 “Pretend you are. Where shall we go? To Greece, where every stone is
 hallowed ground to you. All the white new buildings shall be blotted out
 and you may turn your back on the museum....”
 
 “I shall only want to look at you.”
 
 “No, on rocks and the blue Ægean Sea. No, we won’t go to Greece at all.
 You will be so learned, know so much more than I about everything. I
 shall feel small, insignificant.”
 
 “Never. Bigger than the Pantheon.”
 
 “We will go to Sicily instead, go down among the tombs.”
 
 “I bar the tombs.”
 
 “Contradicting me already. How dare you, sir?”
 
 So the time passed in happy fooling, but often their hands met, the
 under-currents between them ran swift and strong, deep too. Then it was
 time for lunch. It was Margaret who suggested they would be in time to
 meet Anne, walk up to the house with her. Nothing had been said about
 Dr. Kennedy. Gabriel had meant to broach the subject, only touch it
 lightly, suggest if she still needed medical attendance some one older,
 less interested might perhaps be advisable.
 
 But he never did broach the subject, it had been impossible on such a
 morning as this, she in such a mood, he in such accord with her. Anne,
 when they met her, dashed them both a little. She twittered away about
 the service and the sermon, but it was nervous and disjointed twitter,
 and her eyes were red. She responded awkwardly to all Margaret’s kind
 speeches, her enquiries after her headache; she was even guilty of the
 heinous offence, heinous in her own eyes when she remembered it
 afterwards, of saying nothing of the other’s faintness. Her landmarks
 had been swept away, the ground yawned under her feet. Divorce! She did
 not think she could live in the house with a divorced person. She knew
 that some clergymen would not even marry divorced people, nor give them
 the sacrament. She was miserably distressed, and longing to be at home.
 She felt she was assisting at something indecorous, if not worse; she
 thought she ought not to have waited for the sermon, she ought not to
 have left them so long alone together. All her mingled emotions made her
 feel ill again. She told Gabriel crossly that he was walking too fast.
 
 “Perhaps Mrs. Capel likes fast walking? Don’t mind me if you do,” she
 said to Margaret, “I can manage by myself.”
 
 When they had adapted their pace to hers she was little better
 satisfied; querulous, and as Margaret had pictured her before they met.
 Luncheon was a miserable meal, or would have been but that nothing could
 have really damped the spirits of these other two. First Anne found
 herself in a draught, and then too hot. She never eat eggs, and
 explained about her digestion, the asparagus tops could not tempt her. A
 lobster mayonnaise was a fresh offence or disappointment. And she could
 not disguise her disapproval. After all she prided herself she did know
 something about housekeeping.
 
 “I never give Gabriel eggs except for breakfast.”
 
 “I do hope I have not upset your liver.” Margaret’s eyes were full of
 laughter when she questioned him.
 
 “In my young days, in my papa’s house, nor for the matter of that in my
 uncle’s either, did we ever have lobster salad except for a supper
 dish.”
 
 Gabriel suggested gently that the whole art of eating had altered in
 England.
 
 “Cod and egg sauce,” put in Margaret.
 
 “Nectar and ambrosia.”
 
 “We never gave either of them,” said poor hungry Anne.
 
 Fortunately a spatchcock with mushrooms was produced, and the _mousse_
 of _jambon_, although it seemed “odd,” was very light.
 
 “Why didn’t I have boiled mutton and rice pudding?” Margaret lamented in
 an aside to Gabriel when the _omelette au rhum_ was most decisively
 declined. Cream cheese and gingerbread proved the last straw. Anne
 admitted it made her feel ill to see the others eat these in
 combination.
 
 “I should like to get back to town as early as possible this afternoon,”
 she said. “I am sure I don’t know what has come over me, I felt well
 before I came. The place cannot agree with me. I hope you don’t think me
 very rude, but if we can have a fly for the first train....”
 
 Gabriel was full of consternation and remonstrated with her. Margaret
 whispered to him it was better so. Nothing was to be gained by detaining
 her against her will.
 
 “We have next week....”
 
 “All the weeks,” he whispered back.
 
 Margaret offered Stevens’ services, but Anne said she preferred to pack
 for herself, then she knew just where everything was. The lovers had an
 hour to themselves whilst she was engaged in this congenial occupation.
 She reminded Gabriel that he too must put his things together, and he
 agreed. She thought this made matters safe.
 
 “Stevens will do them for you,” Margaret said softly. He did not care
 how they were jumbled in, or what left behind, so that he secured this
 precious hour.
 
 “Something has upset her, it was not only the lunch,” Margaret said
 sapiently. He did not wish to enlighten her.
 
 “Has she worried you, beloved one?”
 
 “Not very much, not as much as she ought to perhaps. I was selfish with
 her, left her too much alone. I shall know better another time. But at
 least we had yesterday afternoon, and this morning ... oh! and part of
 the evening, too. Did I frighten you very much?” she asked him.
 
 “Before I had time to be frightened you smiled, something of your colour
 came back. Margaret, that reminds me. Do you mind if I suggest to you
 that if you were really seedy Dr. Kennedy is comparatively a young
 man....” She laughed.
 
 “But look how devoted he is!”
 
 “That is why.” He spoke a little gravely, and she put her hand in his.
 
 “Jealous!” Her voice was very soft.
 
 “The whole world loves you.”
 
 “I don’t love the whole world.” And when she said this her voice was no
 longer only soft, it was tenderness itself.
 
 “Thank God!” He kissed her hand.
 
 But returned to his text as a man will. “No, I am not jealous. How could
 I be? You have honoured me, dowered me beyond all other men. But you are
 so precious, so supremely and unutterably precious. Margaret, my heart
 is suddenly shaken. Tell me again. You are not ill, not really ill? When
 this trying time is over, when I can be with you always....”
 
 “How about those hours I want to myself?” she interrupted.
 
 “When I can be within sound of you, taking care of you all the time, you
 will be well then?” Now she put a hand on his knee. “Your little fairy
 hand!” he exclaimed, capturing it.
 
 “I want you to listen,” she began. She did not know or believe herself
 that she was seriously ill, but remembered what Dr. Lansdowne had said
 and shivered over it a little.
 
 “Suppose I am really ill, that it is heart disease with me as the German
 doctors and Lansdowne told me? Not only heart weakness as the others
 say, would you be afraid? Do you think I ought not to ... to marry?”
 
 “My darling, it is impossible, your beautiful vitality makes it
 impossible. But if it were true, incredibly true, then all the more
 reason that we should be married as quickly as possible. I must snatch
 you up, carry you away.” There was an interlude. “You want petting....”
 He was a little awkward at it nevertheless, inexperienced.
 
 “Isn’t there some great man you could see, and who would reassure you,
 some specialist?”
 
 “The Roopes?” She laughed, and her short fit of seriousness was over.
 
 “I will find out who is the best man, the head of the profession. No one
 but the best is good enough for my Margaret. You will let me take you to
 him?”
 
 “Perhaps. When I come back to London; if I am not well by then.”
 
 “You like this place, don’t you?” he asked. “You don’t think it is the
 place?”
 
 “Pineland and Carbies? I am not sure. If I had not taken it for three
 months I believe I’d go back today or tomorrow. I ran away from you ...
 and social guns. I’m armed now.” He thanked her for that mutely. “Do you
 really love this ill-fixed house?”
 
 “How should I not? But what does that matter? Leave it empty if it
 doesn’t suit you. There is Queen Anne’s Gate.”
 
 “I know, but we should never be alone.”
 
 “Nothing matters but that you should be well, happy. I’d take my
 vacation now, stay down, only I want at least six weeks in June. I could
 not do with less than six weeks.” And this time the interlude was
 longer, more silent. Margaret recovered herself first.
 
 “About Peter Kennedy. He really suits me better than any of the other
 doctors here. Lansdowne is a soft-soapy grinning pessimist, with an
 all-conquering air. He tells you how ill you are as if it doesn’t matter
 since he has warned you, and will come constantly to remind you. There
 is a Dr. Lushington who, I believe, knows more than all of them put
 together, but he is a delicate man himself, overburdened with children,
 and cramped with small means. He gives me fresh heartache, I am so sorry
 for him all the time he is with me. Lansdowne and Lushington have each
 young partners or assistants, straight from London hospitals, smelling
 of iodoform, talking in abstruse medical or surgical terms, nosing for
 operations, as dogs for truffles. You don’t want me to have any of
 these, do you?”
 
 “I want you to do what you please, now and always.”
 
 “Even if it pleases me that Peter Kennedy should medicine and make love
 to me?”
 
 “Even that. Does he make love to you?”
 
 “What did he tell you?”
 
 “That he adored you—that you treated him like a dog.”
 
 “He gives me amyl, bromide. He was only a country practitioner when I
 first knew him, with a gift for music, but not for diagnosis.”
 
 “And now?”
 
 “He has done more reading, medical reading, since I have been here than
 in all his life before. Treatises on the heart; all that have ever been
 written. He is really studying, he intends to take a higher degree. In
 music too, I have given him an impetus.”
 
 Gabriel was obviously, nevertheless, not quite satisfied, started a
 tentative “but,” and would perhaps have enquired whether ultimately it
 would be for Peter Kennedy’s good that she had done so much for him.
 Anne, however, intervened, coming down dressed for the journey, very
 agitated at finding the two together. She gave him no opportunity for
 further conversation, monopolising the attention of the whole household,
 in searching for something she had mislaid, which it was eventually
 decided had possibly been left in Hampstead! Her conscience reproached
 her for her behaviour over lunch, and she found the cup of tea which
 Margaret pressed upon her before she left “delicious.”
 
 “I do so much like this Chinese tea, ever so much better than the
 Indian. You remember, Gabriel, don’t you, that rough tea we used to have
 from Pounds?...” And she told a wholly irrelevant anecdote of rival
 grocers and their wares.
 
 She betrayed altogether in the last ten minutes an uneasy
 semi-consciousness that her visit had not been a great success and
 talked quickly in belated apology.
 
 “You’ve been so kind to me. I am afraid I have not responded as I ought.
 My silly headache, which of course I never exactly had ... you know what
 I mean, don’t you? And I did no credit to your beautiful lunch.”
 
 Margaret succeeded in assuring her that she had behaved exactly as a
 guest should, whilst Gabriel stood by silently.
 
 “I hope you will come again,” she said, and Anne replied nervously,
 noncommittal.
 
 “That would be nice, wouldn’t it? But I am always so busy, and now that

 “Oh! you have seen inside, then?”
 
 “Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”
 
 “There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”
 
 “No. What a strange idea!”
 
 “Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on
 the top of it.
 
 “No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”
 
 “Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
 saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I dare
 say. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted
 down in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the
 greatest attention.
 
 “Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his
 lens in his pocket. “Hello! Here is something interesting!”
 
 The object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one
 corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied
 so as to make a loop of whip-cord.
 
 “What do you make of that, Watson?”
 
 “It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”
 
 “That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world,
 and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of
 all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your
 permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”
 
 I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it
 was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked
 several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself
 liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his
 reverie.
 
 “It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should
 absolutely follow my advice in every respect.”
 
 “I shall most certainly do so.”
 
 “The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend
 upon your compliance.”
 
 “I assure you that I am in your hands.”
 
 “In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your
 room.”
 
 Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
 
 “Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village
 inn over there?”
 
 “Yes, that is the ‘Crown.’”
 
 “Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”
 
 “Certainly.”
 
 “You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,
 when your step-father comes back. Then when you hear him retire for
 the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp,
 put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with
 everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to
 occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage
 there for one night.”
 
 “Oh yes, easily.”
 
 “The rest you will leave in our hands.”
 
 “But what will you do?”
 
 “We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the
 cause of this noise which has disturbed you.”
 
 “I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said
 Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.
 
 “Perhaps I have.”
 
 “Then for pity’s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”
 
 “I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”
 
 “You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she
 died from some sudden fright.”
 
 [Illustration: “‘GOOD-BYE, AND BE BRAVE’”]
 
 “No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more
 tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you, for if Dr.
 Roylott returned and saw us, our journey would be in vain. Good-bye,
 and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest
 assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
 sitting-room at the “Crown Inn.” They were on the upper floor, and
 from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the
 inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby
 Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure
 of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing
 the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s
 voice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.
 The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring
 up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
 
 “Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes, as we sat together in the gathering
 darkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There
 is a distinct element of danger.”
 
 “Can I be of assistance?”
 
 “Your presence might be invaluable.”
 
 “Then I shall certainly come.”
 
 “It is very kind of you.”
 
 “You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than
 was visible to me.”
 
 “No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that
 you saw all that I did.”
 
 “I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that
 could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”
 
 “You saw the ventilator, too?”
 
 “Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have
 a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could
 hardly pass through.”
 
 “I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke
 Moran.”
 
 “My dear Holmes!”
 
 “Oh yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister
 could smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once
 that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only
 be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s
 inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”
 
 “But what harm can there be in that?”
 
 “Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator
 is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does
 not that strike you?”
 
 “I cannot as yet see any connection.”
 
 “Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that
 before?”
 
 “I cannot say that I have.”
 
 “The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
 relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—for so we may call
 it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”
 
 “Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are
 only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”
 
 “Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong, he is
 the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and
 Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes
 even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike
 deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is
 over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our minds
 for a few hours to something more cheerful.”
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all
 was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly
 away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single
 bright light shone out right in front of us.
 
 “That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes
 from the middle window.”
 
 As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining
 that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was
 possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were
 out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow
 light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our
 sombre errand.
 
 There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired
 breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees,
 we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the
 window, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed
 to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass
 with writhing limbs, and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the
 darkness.
 
 “My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”
 
 Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice
 upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh, and put
 his lips to my ear.
 
 “It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”
 
 I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was
 a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any
 moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following
 Holmes’s example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the
 bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp
 onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had
 seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of
 his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that
 I could do to distinguish the words:
 
 “The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”
 
 I nodded to show that I had heard.
 
 “We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”
 
 I nodded again.
 
 “Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol
 ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and
 you in that chair.”
 
 I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
 
 Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed
 beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.
 Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.
 
 How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,
 not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion
 sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous
 tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray
 of light, and we waited in absolute darkness. From outside came the
 occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long
 drawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at
 liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,
 which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those
 quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat
 waiting silently for whatever might befall.
 
 Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction
 of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by
 a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Some one in the next
 room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and
 then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half
 an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became
 audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of
 steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,
 Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
 his cane at the bell-pull.
 
 “You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”
 
 But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard
 a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes
 made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed
 so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and
 filled with horror and loathing.
 
 He had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when
 suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible
 cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a
 hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful
 shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant
 parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold
 to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the
 last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.
 
 “What can it mean?” I gasped.
 
 “It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after
 all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.
 Roylott’s room.”
 
 With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.
 Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.
 Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked
 pistol in my hand.
 
 It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
 dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam
 of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this
 table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, clad in a long
 gray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet
 thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short
 stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin
 was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare
 at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow
 band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round
 his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
 
 “The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.
 
 I took a step forward. In an instant his strange head-gear began
 to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
 diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
 
 “It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He
 has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,
 recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he
 digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and
 we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter, and let the
 county police know what has happened.”
 
 As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and
 throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck, he drew it from its horrid
 perch, and carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,
 which he closed upon it.
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke
 Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has
 already run to too great a length, by telling how we broke the sad news
 to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the
 care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official
 inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while
 indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet
 to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled
 back next day.
 
 “I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which
 shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from
 insufficient data. The presence of the gypsies, and the use of the
 word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the
 appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of
 her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I
 can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position
 when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened
 an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the
 door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to
 you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the
 bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped
 to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
 there as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming
 to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when
 I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a
 supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right
 track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be
 discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a
 clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity
 with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point
 of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who
 could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
 the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of
 course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to
 the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which
 we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this
 ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it
 would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not
 bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
 sooner or later she must fall a victim.
 
 “I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.
 An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of
 standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he
 should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,
 and the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts
 which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was
 obviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his
 safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know
 the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I
 heard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did also, and I
 instantly lit the light and attacked it.”
 
 “With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”
 
 “And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the
 other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its
 snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this
 way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s
 death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my
 conscience.”
 
 
 
 
 Adventure IX
 
 THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER’S THUMB
 
 
 Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend Mr. Sherlock
 Holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only
 two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that of Mr.
 Hatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of these
 the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original
 observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic
 in its details, that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon
 record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive
 methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The
 story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,
 like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set
 forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts
 slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually
 away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the
 complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression
 upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the
 effect.
 
 It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the
 events occurred which I am now about to summarize. I had returned to
 civil practice, and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street
 rooms, although I continually visited him, and occasionally even
 persuaded him to forego his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit
 us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at
 no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients
 from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful
 and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues, and
 of endeavoring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any
 influence.
 
 One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by
 the maid tapping at the door, to announce that two men had come
 from Paddington, and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed
 hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom
 trivial, and hastened down-stairs. As I descended, my old ally, the
 guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
 
 “I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;
 “he’s all right.”
 
 “What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some
 strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
 
 “It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round
 myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I
 must go now, doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off
 he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
 
 I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
 table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed, with a soft
 cloth cap, which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his
 hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with
 blood-stains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should
 say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale, and
 gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong
 agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.
 
 “I am sorry to knock you up so early, doctor,” said he, “but I have
 had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this
 morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a
 doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a
 card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”
 
 I took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic
 engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3d floor).” That was the name,
 style, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you
 waiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh
 from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous
 occupation.”
 
 “Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He
 laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his
 chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against
 that laugh.
 
 “Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I poured out some
 water from a caraffe.
 
 It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical
 outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is
 over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and
 blushing hotly.
 
 “I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.
 
 “Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, and the
 color began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
 
 “That’s better!” said he. “And now, doctor, perhaps you would kindly
 attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.”
 
 He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my
 hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding
 fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have
 been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
 
 “Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It must have bled
 considerably.”
 
 “Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have
 been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was
 still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly
 round the wrist, and braced it up with a twig.”
 
 “Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”
 
 “It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
 province.”
 
 “This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and
 sharp instrument.”
 
 “A thing like a cleaver,” said he.
 
 “An accident, I presume?”
 
 “By no means.”
 
 “What! a murderous attack?”
 
 “Very murderous indeed.”
 
 “You horrify me.”
 
 I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it
 over with cotton wadding and carbolized bandages. He lay back without
 wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
 
 “How is that?” I asked, when I had finished.
 
 “Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was
 very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”
 
 “Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying
 to your nerves.”
 
 “Oh no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,
 between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this
 wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement; for
 it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof
 with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clews which
 I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will
 be done.”
 
 “Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you
 desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my
 friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes before you go to the official police.”
 
 “Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and I should
 be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must
 use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to
 him?”
 
 “I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”
 
 “I should be immensely obliged to you.”
 
 “We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a
 little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”
 
 “Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”
 
 “Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
 instant.” I rushed up-stairs, explained the matter shortly to my
 wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new
 acquaintance to Baker Street.
 
 Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in
 his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_, and smoking
 his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and
 dottels left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried
 and collected on the corner of the mantel-piece. He received us in his
 quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us
 in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance
 upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
 brandy-and-water within his reach.
 
 “It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.
 Hatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely
 at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up
 your strength with a little stimulant.”
 
 “Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another man since the
 doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the
 cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I
 shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.”
 
 Holmes sat in his big arm-chair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression
 which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,
 and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor
 detailed to us.
 
 “You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing
 alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am an hydraulic engineer,
 and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven
 years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known
 firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having
 also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death,
 I determined to start in business for myself, and took professional
 chambers in Victoria Street.
 
 “I suppose that every one finds his first independent start in business
 a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two
 years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is
 absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings
 amount to £27 10_s._ Every day, from nine in the morning until four in
 the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began
 to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at
 all.
 
 “Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office,
 my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to
 see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of
 ‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the
 colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding
 thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole
 face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks
 was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation
 seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was
 bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but
 neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
 thirty.
 
 “‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You
 have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not
 only proficient in his profession, but is also discreet and capable of
 preserving a secret.’
",Holmes
37," hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.
 
 Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment
 while this hurried conversation was proceeding. The former now held out
 his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between
 them. The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions
 from his young friend, a precise account of his patient’s situation;
 which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver’s
 statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr.
 Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy
 ears.
 
 “Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?” inquired the
 doctor, when he had concluded.
 
 “Nothing particular, sir,” replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.
 
 “Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?” said
 the doctor.
 
 “None at all, sir,” replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.
 
 “Well,” said the doctor, “I am sorry to hear it, because you do that
 sort of thing admirably. Pray, how is Brittles?”
 
 “The boy is very well, sir,” said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone
 of patronage; “and sends his respectful duty, sir.”
 
 “That’s well,” said the doctor. “Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr.
 Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so
 hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small
 commission in your favour. Just step into this corner a moment, will
 you?”
 
 Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,
 and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on
 the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with
 steps of unusual stateliness. The subject matter of this conference was
 not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened
 concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called
 for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly
 effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his
 gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to
 deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds,
 for his sole use and benefit. At this, the two women-servants lifted up
 their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his
 shirt-frill, replied, “No, no”; and that if they observed that he was
 at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so.
 And then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of
 his humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and
 were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of
 great men commonly are.
 
 Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for
 the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful
 Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the
 worthy gentleman’s good humour, which displayed itself in a great
 variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of
 small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had
 ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident
 satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and
 made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy. So,
 they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could
 well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and
 thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and
 suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.
 
 Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual
 occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many
 days. The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places;
 and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more
 gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had
 seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over
 every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic. The dew
 seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle
 among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue
 and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own
 thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects. Men
 who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and
 gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from
 their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and
 need a clearer vision.
 
 It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time,
 that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie,
 after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was
 seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in
 their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind. If Oliver
 were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be
 found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and
 brought home the fairest that blossomed. The window of the young lady’s
 chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air
 stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in
 water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was
 made up with great care, every morning. Oliver could not help noticing
 that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little
 vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that
 whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes
 up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as
 he set forth on his morning’s walk. Pending these observations, the
 days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.
 
 Nor did Oliver’s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady
 had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now
 and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself,
 with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old
 gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even
 himself. It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was
 greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.
 
 The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his
 books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house. It was quite
 a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of
 jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the
 place with their delicious perfume. It looked into a garden, whence a
 wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine
 meadow-land and wood. There was no other dwelling near, in that
 direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.
 
 One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning
 to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his
 books. He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had
 been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is
 no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say,
 that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.
 
 There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it
 holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things
 about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. So far as an
 overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter
 inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called
 sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is
 going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are
 really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate
 themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and
 imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost
 matter of impossibility to separate the two. Nor is this, the most
 striking phenomenon incidental to such a state. It is an undoubted
 fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead,
 yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before
 us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent
 presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when
 we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking
 consciousness.
 
 Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that
 his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was
 stirring among the creeping plants outside. And yet he was asleep.
 Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he
 thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew’s house again.
 There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at
 him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat
 beside him.
 
 “Hush, my dear!” he thought he heard the Jew say; “it is he, sure
 enough. Come away.”
 
 “He!” the other man seemed to answer; “could I mistake him, think you?
 If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and
 he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to
 point him out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across
 his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn’t a mark above it, that
 he lay buried there?”
 
 The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver
 awoke with the fear, and started up.
 
 Good Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart,
 and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There—there—at the
 window—close before him—so close, that he could have almost touched him
 before he started back: with his eyes peering into the room, and
 meeting his: there stood the Jew! And beside him, white with rage or
 fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted
 him in the inn-yard.
 
 It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they
 were gone. But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was
 as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in
 stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed for a
 moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly
 for help.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXV.
 CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER’S ADVENTURE; AND A
 CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE
 
 
 When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver’s cries, hurried to
 the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,
 pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely
 able to articulate the words, “The Jew! the Jew!”
 
 Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry
 Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard
 Oliver’s history from his mother, understood it at once.
 
 “What direction did he take?” he asked, catching up a heavy stick which
 was standing in a corner.
 
 “That,” replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; “I
 missed them in an instant.”
 
 “Then, they are in the ditch!” said Harry. “Follow! And keep as near
 me, as you can.” So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off
 with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the
 others to keep near him.
 
 Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the
 course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and
 just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking
 himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to
 possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting
 all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.
 
 On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader,
 striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to
 search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time
 for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to
 communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so
 vigorous a pursuit.
 
 The search was all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent
 footsteps, to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill,
 commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.
 There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain
 that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must
 have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could
 have accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood skirted the
 meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that
 covert for the same reason.
 
 “It must have been a dream, Oliver,” said Harry Maylie.
 
 “Oh no, indeed, sir,” replied Oliver, shuddering at the very
 recollection of the old wretch’s countenance; “I saw him too plainly
 for that. I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.”
 
 “Who was the other?” inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.
 
 “The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the
 inn,” said Oliver. “We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I
 could swear to him.”
 
 “They took this way?” demanded Harry: “are you sure?”
 
 “As I am that the men were at the window,” replied Oliver, pointing
 down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from
 the meadow. “The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running
 a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.”
 
 The two gentlemen watched Oliver’s earnest face, as he spoke, and
 looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the
 accuracy of what he said. Still, in no direction were there any
 appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was
 long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had
 crushed it. The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but
 in no one place could they discern the print of men’s shoes, or the
 slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the
 ground for hours before.
 
 “This is strange!” said Harry.
 
 “Strange?” echoed the doctor. “Blathers and Duff, themselves, could
 make nothing of it.”
 
 Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did
 not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further
 prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance.
 Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village,
 furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance
 and dress of the strangers. Of these, the Jew was, at all events,
 sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen
 drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any
 intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.
 
 On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but
 with no better success. On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie
 repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something
 of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless. After a few
 days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when
 wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.
 
 Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. She had left her room: was able
 to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the
 hearts of all.
 
 But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little
 circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more
 heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon
 some there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to
 remark. Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long
 time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her
 face. After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey,
 these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in
 progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody
 else besides.
 
 At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour,
 Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to
 speak with her for a few moments.
 
 “A few—a very few—will suffice, Rose,” said the young man, drawing his
 chair towards her. “What I shall have to say, has already presented
 itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not
 unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.”
 
 Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might
 have been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and
 bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to
 proceed.
 
 “I—I—ought to have left here, before,” said Harry.
 
 “You should, indeed,” replied Rose. “Forgive me for saying so, but I
 wish you had.”
 
 “I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all
 apprehensions,” said the young man; “the fear of losing the one dear
 being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed. You had been dying;
 trembling between earth and heaven. We know that when the young, the
 beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits
 insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know,
 Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade
 in blooming.”
 
 There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were
 spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and
 glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as
 though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred
 naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.
 
 “A creature,” continued the young man, passionately, “a creature as
 fair and innocent of guile as one of God’s own angels, fluttered
 between life and death. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to
 which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to
 the sorrow and calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were
 passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts
 upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who
 linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that
 you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and
 the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all
 these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved
 you—these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine,
 by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears,
 and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never
 know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in
 its course. You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some
 drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream
 of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a
 high and rushing tide. I have watched you change almost from death, to
 life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep
 affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has
 softened my heart to all mankind.”
 
 “I did not mean that,” said Rose, weeping; “I only wish you had left
 here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to
 pursuits well worthy of you.”
 
 “There is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest
 nature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,”
 said the young man, taking her hand. “Rose, my own dear Rose! For
 years—for years—I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and
 then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to
 share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy
 moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy’s attachment,
 and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that
 had been sealed between us! That time has not arrived; but here, with
 not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so
 long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the
 offer.”
 
 “Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.” said Rose, mastering the
 emotions by which she was agitated. “As you believe that I am not
 insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.”
 
 “It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?”
 
 “It is,” replied Rose, “that you must endeavour to forget me; not as
 your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply;
 but, as the object of your love. Look into the world; think how many
 hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other
 passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most
 faithful friend you have.”
 
 There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with
 one hand, gave free vent to her tears. Harry still retained the other.
 
 “And your reasons, Rose,” he said, at length, in a low voice; “your
 reasons for this decision?”
 
 “You have a right to know them,” rejoined Rose. “You can say nothing to
 alter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform. I owe it, alike
 to others, and to myself.”
 
 “To yourself?”
 
 “Yes, Harry. I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless,
 girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason
 to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and
 fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects. I owe it to
 you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your
 generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.”
 
 “If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty—” Harry began.
 
 “They do not,” replied Rose, colouring deeply.
 
 “Then you return my love?” said Harry. “Say but that, dear Rose; say
 but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!”
 
 “If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,”
 rejoined Rose, “I could have—”
 
 “Have received this declaration very differently?” said Harry. “Do not
 conceal that from me, at least, Rose.”
 
 “I could,” said Rose. “Stay!” she added, disengaging her hand, “why
 should we prolong this painful interview? Most painful to me, and yet
 productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be
 happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which
 I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me
 with new fortitude and firmness. Farewell, Harry! As we have met
 to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which
 this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined;
 and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can
 call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper
 you!”
 
 “Another word, Rose,” said Harry. “Your reason in your own words. From
 your own lips, let me hear it!”
 
 “The prospect before you,” answered Rose, firmly, “is a brilliant one.
 All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can
 help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections
 are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the
 mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of
 her who has so well supplied that mother’s place. In a word,” said the
 young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, “there
 is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads. I
 will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest
 alone on me.”
 
 “One word more, Rose. Dearest Rose! one more!” cried Harry, throwing
 himself before her. “If I had been less—less fortunate, the world would
 call it—if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny—if I had
 been poor, sick, helpless—would you have turned from me then? Or has my
 probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?”
 
 “Do not press me to reply,” answered Rose. “The question does not
 arise, and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.”
 
 “If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,” retorted Harry,
 “it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the
 path before me. It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance
 of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. Oh, Rose:
 in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I
 have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this
 one question!”
 
 “Then, if your lot had been differently cast,” rejoined Rose; “if you
 had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been
 a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement,
 and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I
 should have been spared this trial. I have every reason to be happy,
 very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.”
 
 Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded
 into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears
 with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they
 relieved her.
 
 “I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,” said
 Rose, extending her hand. “I must leave you now, indeed.”
 
 “I ask one promise,” said Harry. “Once, and only once more,—say within
 a year, but it may be much sooner,—I may speak to you again on this
 subject, for the last time.”
 
 “Not to press me to alter my right determination,” replied Rose, with a
 melancholy smile; “it will be useless.”
 
 “No,” said Harry; “to hear you repeat it, if you will—finally repeat
 it! I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may
 possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not
 seek, by word or act, to change it.”
 
 “Then let it be so,” rejoined Rose; “it is but one pang the more, and
 by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.”
 
 She extended her hand again. But the young man caught her to his bosom;
 and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the
 room.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXVI.
 IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS
 PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST,
 AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES
 
 
 “And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning;
 eh?” said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the
 breakfast-table. “Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two
 half-hours together!”
 
 “You will tell me a different tale one of these days,” said Harry,
 colouring without any perceptible reason.
 
 “I hope I may have good cause to do so,” replied Mr. Losberne; “though
 I confess I don’t think I shall. But yesterday morning you had made up
 your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your
 mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce
 that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I
 go, on your road to London. And at night, you urge me, with great
 mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of
 which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when
 he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all
 kinds. Too bad, isn’t it, Oliver?”
 
 “I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and
 Mr. Maylie went away, sir,” rejoined Oliver.
 
 “That’s a fine fellow,” said the doctor; “you shall come and see me
 when you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication
 from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be
 gone?”
 
 “The great nobs,” replied Harry, “under which designation, I presume,
 you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at
 all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it
 likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate
 attendance among them.”
 
 “Well,” said the doctor, “you are a queer fellow. But of course they
 will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and
 these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political
 life. There’s something in that. Good training is always desirable,
 whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.”
 
 Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue
 by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a
 little; but he contented himself with saying, “We shall see,” and
 pursued the subject no farther. The post-chaise drove up to the door
 shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good
 doctor bustled out, to see it packed.
 
 “Oliver,” said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, “let me speak a word with
 you.”
 
 Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him;
 much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which
 his whole behaviour displayed.
 
 “You can write well now?” said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.
 
 “I hope so, sir,” replied Oliver.
 
 “I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would
 write to me—say once a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the
 General Post Office in London. Will you?”
 
 “Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,” exclaimed Oliver,
 greatly delighted with the commission.
 
 “I should like to know how—how my mother and Miss Maylie are,” said the
 young man; “and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you
 take, and what you talk about, and whether she—they, I mean—seem happy
 and quite well. You understand me?”
 
 “Oh! quite, sir, quite,” replied Oliver.
 
 “I would rather you did not mention it to them,” said Harry, hurrying
 over his words; “because it might make my mother anxious to write to me
 oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret
 between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon
 you.”
 
 Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance,
 faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.
 Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and
 protection.
 
 The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should
 be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants
 were in the garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight glance at the
 latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.
 
 “Drive on!” he cried, “hard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying
 will keep pace with me, to-day.”
 
 “Halloa!” cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great
 hurry, and shouting to the postillion; “something very short of flying
 will keep pace with _me_. Do you hear?”
 
 Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible,
 and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound
 its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly
 disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects,
 or the intricacies of the way, permitted. It was not until even the
 dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.
 
 And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot
 where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away;
 for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when
 Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.
 
 “He seems in high spirits and happy,” she said, at length. “I feared
 for a time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very
 glad.”
 
 Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed
 down Rose’s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in
 the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXVII.
 IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN
 MATRIMONIAL CASES
 
 
 Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on
 the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam
 proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which
 were sent back from its cold and shining surface. A paper fly-cage
 dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in
 gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy
 net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy
 shadow overspread his countenance. Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might
 be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own
 past life.
 
 Nor was Mr. Bumble’s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a
 pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting
 other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person,
 which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of
 his affairs. The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He
 still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether
 limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches. The coat was wide-skirted; and
 in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different! The mighty
 cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one. Mr. Bumble was no longer
 a beadle.
 
 There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more
 substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from
 the coats and waistcoats connected with them. A field-marshal has his
 uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle
 his cocked hat. Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat
 and lace; what are they? Men. Mere men. Dignity, and even holiness too,
 sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people
 imagine.
 
 Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.
 Another beadle had come into power. On him the cocked hat, gold-laced
 coat, and staff, had all three descended.
 
 “And to-morrow two months it was done!” said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh.
 “It seems a age.”
 
 Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence
 of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh—there
 was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.
 
 “I sold myself,” said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection,
 “for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small
 quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money. I went
 very reasonable. Cheap, dirt cheap!”
 
 “Cheap!” cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble’s ear: “you would have been
 dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows
 that!”
 
 Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort,
 who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his
 complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.
 
 “Mrs. Bumble, ma’am!” said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.
 
 “Well!” cried the lady.
 
 “Have the goodness to look at me,” said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes
 upon her.
 
 “If she stands such a eye as that,” said Mr. Bumble to himself, “she
 can stand anything. It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers. If
 it fails with her, my power is gone.”
 
 Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell
 paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or
 whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle
 glances; are matters of opinion. The matter of fact, is, that the
 matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble’s scowl, but, on the
 contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh
 thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.
 
 On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first
 incredulous, and afterwards amazed. He then relapsed into his former
 state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened
 by the voice of his partner.
 
 “Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?” inquired Mrs. Bumble.
 
 “I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma’am,” rejoined
 Mr. Bumble; “and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape,
 sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my
 prerogative.”
 
 “_Your_ prerogative!” sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.
 
 “I said the word, ma’am,” said Mr. Bumble. “The prerogative of a man is
 to command.”
 
 “And what’s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?” cried
 the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.
 
 “To obey, ma’am,” thundered Mr. Bumble. “Your late unfortunate husband
 should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive
 now. I wish he was, poor man!”
 
 Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now
 arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or
 other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this
 allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with
 a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a
 paroxysm of tears.
 
 But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble’s soul;
 his heart was waterproof. Like washable beaver hats that improve with
 rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of
 tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of
 his own power, pleased and exalted him. He eyed his good lady with
 looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that
 she should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the
 faculty, as strongly conducive to health.
 
 “It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and
 softens down the temper,” said Mr. Bumble. “So cry away.”
 
 As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat
 from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man
 might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner,
 thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with
 much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.
 
 Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less
 troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make
 trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in
 discovering.
 
 The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow
 sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the
 opposite end of the room. This preliminary proceeding laying bare his
 head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one
 hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and
 dexterity) upon it with the other. This done, she created a little
 variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by
 this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the
 offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated
 for the purpose: and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if
 he dared.
 
 “Get up!” said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. “And take yourself
 away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.”
 
 Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what
 something desperate might be. Picking up his hat, he looked towards the
 door.
 
 “Are you going?” demanded Mrs. Bumble.
 
 “Certainly, my dear, certainly,” rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker
 motion towards the door. “I didn’t intend to—I’m going, my dear! You
 are so very violent, that really I—”
 
 At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the
 carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle. Mr. Bumble immediately
 darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his
 unfinished sentence: leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of
 the field.
 
 Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. He had a
 decided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure
 from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is
 needless to say) a coward. This is by no means a disparagement to his
 character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect
 and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities. The remark is
 made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of
 impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for
 office.
 
 But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full. After making a
 tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws
 really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their
 wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be
 visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious
 individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some
 of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish
 linen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.
 
 “Hem!” said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. “These
 women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo
 there! What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?”
 
 With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very
 fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most
 humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the
 form of his lady wife.
 
 “My dear,” said Mr. Bumble, “I didn’t know you were here.”
 
 “Didn’t know I was here!” repeated Mrs. Bumble. “What do _you_ do
 here?”
 
 “I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work
 properly, my dear,” replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a
 couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of
 admiration at the workhouse-master’s humility.
 
 “_You_ thought they were talking too much?” said Mrs. Bumble. “What
 business is it of yours?”
 
 “Why, my dear—” urged Mr. Bumble submissively.
 
 “What business is it of yours?” demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.
 
 “It’s very true, you’re matron here, my dear,” submitted Mr. Bumble;
 “but I thought you mightn’t be in the way just then.”
 
 “I’ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,” returned his lady. “We don’t want any
 of your interference. You’re a great deal too fond of poking your nose
 into things that don’t concern you, making everybody in the house
 laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a
 fool every hour in the day. Be off; come!”
 
 Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two
 old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated
 for an instant. Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up
 a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him
 instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly
 person.
 
 What could Mr. Bumble do? He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away;
 and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a
 shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight. It wanted but this. He was
 degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very
 paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to
 the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.
 
 “All in two months!” said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts. “Two
 months! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but
 everybody else’s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and
 now!—”
 
 It was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the
 gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and
 walked, distractedly, into the street.
 
 He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated
 the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made
 him thirsty. He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length
 paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a
 hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary
 customer. It began to rain, heavily, at the moment. This determined
 him. Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he
 passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the
 street.
 
 The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large
 cloak. He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain
 haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to
 have travelled some distance. He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered,
 but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his
 salutation.
 
 Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the
 stranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin-and-water in
 silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.
 
 It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall
 into company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now
 and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a
 look at the stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his
 eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment
 stealing a look at him. Mr. Bumble’s awkwardness was enhanced by the
 very remarkable expression of the stranger’s eye, which was keen and
 bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike
 anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.
 
 When they had encountered each other’s glance several times in this
 way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.
 
 “Were you looking for me,” he said, “when you peered in at the window?”
 
 “Not that I am aware of, unless you’re Mr.—” Here Mr. Bumble stopped
 short; for he was curious to know the stranger’s name, and thought in
 his impatience, he might supply the blank.
 
 “I see you were not,” said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm
 playing about his mouth; “or you have known my name. You don’t know it.
 I would recommend you not to ask for it.”
 
 “I meant no harm, young man,” observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.
 
 “And have done none,” said the stranger.
 
 Another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken
 by the stranger.
 
 “I have seen you before, I think?” said he. “You were differently
 dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should
 know you again. You were beadle here, once; were you not?”
 
 “I was,” said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; “porochial beadle.”
 
 “Just so,” rejoined the other, nodding his head. “It was in that
 character I saw you. What are you now?”
 
 “Master of the workhouse,” rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and
 impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might
 otherwise assume. “Master of the workhouse, young man!”
 
 “You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I
 doubt not?” resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble’s
 eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.
 
 “Don’t scruple to answer freely, man. I know you pretty well, you see.”
 
 “I suppose, a married man,” replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with
 his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident
 perplexity, “is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can,
 than a single one. Porochial officers are not so well paid that they
 can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a
 civil and proper manner.”
 
 The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had
 not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.
 
 “Fill this glass again,” he said, handing Mr. Bumble’s empty tumbler to
 the landlord. “Let it be strong and hot. You like it so, I suppose?”
 
 “Not too strong,” replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.
 
 “You understand what that means, landlord!” said the stranger, drily.
 
 The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a
 steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr.
",OliverTwist
38," Anne nodded her head, threw a kiss. But neither Margaret nor Gabriel was
 conscious of her condescension, only of how long it was from now until
 next Friday.
 
 “I am glad that is over,” Anne said complacently, as the carriage turned
 through the gates. “It was very trying, very trying indeed. In many ways
 she is quite a nice person. But not suited to us, in our quiet lives.
 Divorced too! I thought there was something last night. So ... so
 overdressed and peculiar. I am glad I came down before things had gone
 any further....”
 
 “Further than what?” Gabriel asked her, waking up, if a little slowly,
 to the position. “Margaret and I are to be married in about a month’s
 time. You shall stay on in the flat if you wish. I think I shall be able
 to arrange.... Have you thought about any one you would like to share it
 with you?”
 
 “Any one I should like! Share it with me?”
 
 She was very shrill and he hushed her, although there was no one to hear
 but the flyman, who flicked at the trotting horse and wheezed
 indifferently. They got to the station long before Anne had taken in the
 fact that Gabriel was telling her his intention, not asking her advice.
 In the train; after they got home; and for many weary days she showed
 her unreasoning and ineffective opposition. It was not worth recording,
 or would not be but for the sympathetic interest taken by the Roopes,
 when Anne, reluctantly and under pressure, gave her brother’s
 approaching marriage as a reason for her own impaired health, and the
 failure of their ministrations. Anne felt it her duty to tell them this,
 and Mrs. Roope no less hers to make further enquiries; the results being
 more far-reaching than either of them could have anticipated. James
 Capel was a relation of the Roopes and it was natural they should be
 interested in the wife who had so flagrantly divorced him.
 
 Ten days after Anne’s unlucky visit to Carbies, Gabriel received a
 bewildering telegram. He had been down once in the interval, but had
 found it unnecessary to speak of Anne, her vagaries or vapours. He
 stayed at Carbies because once having done so it seemed absurd that his
 room should remain empty. The very contrast between this visit and the
 last accentuated its intimate charm. Anne was not there, and Peter
 Kennedy’s services not being required, he had the good sense or taste to
 keep away. Margaret, closely questioned, admitted to having stayed a
 couple of days in bed, after the last week-end, admitted to weakness,
 but not illness.
 
 “I have always been like that ever since I was a child. What is called,
 I believe, ‘a little delicate.’ I get very easily over-tired. Then if I
 don’t pull up and recuperate with bed and Benger, I get an attack of
 pain....”
 
 “Of pain! My poor darling!”
 
 “Unbearable. I mean _I_ can’t bear it. Gabriel, don’t you think you are
 doing a very foolish thing, taking this half-broken life of mine?”
 
 “If only the time were here!”
 
 “Sometimes I think it will never come,” she sighed. “I am _clairvoyante_
 in a way. I don’t see myself in harbour.”
 
 “Only three weeks more, then you shall be as _clairvoyante_ as you
 like.” He laughed happily, holding her to him.
 
 On this visit she seemed glad of his love, to depend upon and need him.
 He always had that for which to be glad. In truth that weakness of which
 she spoke, and which was the cause, or perhaps the effect, of two
 unmistakable heart attacks, had left her in the mood for Gabriel
 Stanton, his serious tenderness, and deep, almost overwhelming devotion.
 She was a whimsical, strange little creature, genius as she called
 herself, and for the moment had ceased to act.
 
 The weather changed, it rained almost continuously from Saturday night
 until Monday morning. They spent the time between the music room and the
 uncongenial dining-room where they had their meals. On the sofa, she lay
 practically in his arms, she sheltered there. She had been frightened by
 her own agitation and uncertainty; the attacks that followed. And now
 believed that all she needed was calm; happy certainty; Gabriel Stanton.
 
 “Don’t make me care for you too much,” she said on one of these days. “I
 want you to rest me, not to get excited over you, to keep calm.”
 
 “I am here only for you to use. Think of me as refuge, sanctuary, what
 you will.”
 
 “A sort of cathedral?”
 
 “You may laugh at me. I like you to laugh at me. Why not as a cathedral,
 cool and restful?”
 
 “Cool and restful,” she repeated. “Yes, you are like that. But suppose I
 want to wander outside, restless creature that I am; suppose nothing you
 do satisfies me?”
 
 “I’ll do more.”
 
 “And after that?”
 
 “Always more.”
 
 There were no scenes between them; Gabriel was not the man for scenes,
 he was deeply happy, humbly happy, not knowing his own worth, much more
 careful of her than any woman could have been, and gentle beyond speech.
 Even in those days she wondered how it would be with her if she were
 well, robust, whether all these little cares would not irritate her,
 whether this was indeed the lover for her. There was something donnish
 and Oxonian about him.
 
 “I’m not sure I look upon you as a cathedral, whether it isn’t more as a
 college.”
 
 When he could not follow her he remained silent.
 
 “Think of me any way you want so long as you do think of me,” he said,
 after a pause.
 
 “I thought you would say that.”
 
 “Was it what you wanted me to say?”
 
 “I only want to hear you say you adore me. You say it so nicely too.”
 
 “Do I? I don’t know what I have done to deserve you.”
 
 “Just loved me,” she said dreamily.
 
 “Any man would do that.”
 
 “Not in the same way.”
 
 “As long as my way pleases you I am the most fortunate of men.”
 
 “Even if I never wrote another line?”
 
 “As if it mattered which way you express yourself, by writing or simply
 living.”
 
 “Such love is enervating. Are you not ambitious for me?”
 
 “You’ve done enough.”
 
 “I am capable of doing much better work.”
 
 “You are capable of anything.”
 
 “Except of that book on Staffordshire Pottery.”
 
 “That was only to have been a stop-gap. You replaced that with me,
 darling that you are!”
 
 “What will Sir George say when he knows?”
 
 “He will say ‘Lucky fellow’ and envy me. Margaret, about how we shall
 live, and where?”
 
 He told her again he was not rich. There was Anne, a certain portion of
 his income must be put aside for Anne.
 
 “You are quite rich enough. For the matter of that I have still my
 marriage settlement. Father would give me more if we needed it. James
 had thousands from him.”
 
 Then they both coloured, she in shame that this ineffable James had ever
 called her wife. He, because the idea that any of her comforts or
 luxuries should emanate from her father or from any one but himself was
 repellent to him. He would have talked ways and means, considered the
 advantages of house or flat, spoken of furniture, but that at first she
 was wayward and said it was unlucky to “count chickens before they were
 boiled, or was it a watched pot?” She would only banter and say things
 that were without meaning or for which he could not find the meaning.
 Presumably, however, she allowed him to lead her back to the subject.
 
 “I have in my mind sometimes a little old house in Westminster, built in
 the seventeenth or eighteenth century, with panelled walls and uneven
 floors. And hunting for furniture in old curiosity shops. It mustn’t be
 earlier than the eighteenth century, by the way. Not too early in that;
 or my Staffordshire won’t look well. In the living-room with the
 eighteenth-century chintz I see all little rosebuds and green leaves. A
 few colour prints on the walls.”
 
 Gabriel had spoken of his collection of old prints. He said he would set
 about looking for the house at once. He told her there were a few such
 still standing, they were snapped up so eagerly.
 
 Soon, quite excitedly they were both planning, talking of old oak, James
 I. silver, William and Mary walnut. Of all their happy hours this I
 think was the happiest they ever spent. Their tastes were so congenial,
 Gabriel’s knowledge so far beyond her own; the home they would build so
 essentially suited to them. There Margaret would write and play, hold
 something of a salon. He would see that all her surroundings were
 appropriate, dignified, congenial. She would be the centre of an
 ascending chorus of admiration. He would, as it were, conduct the band.
 With adoring eyes he would watch her effects, temper this or straighten
 that, setting the stage and noting the audience; all for her
 glorification.
 
 When they parted on that Sunday night they could scarcely tear
 themselves asunder. Three weeks seemed so long, so desperately long.
 Margaret, woman of moods, suddenly launched at him that they would have
 no honeymoon at all. He was to look for the house at once, to find it
 without difficulty.
 
 “Then I’ll come up and confirm; set the painters to work, begin to look
 for things.”
 
 Gabriel pleaded for his honeymoon.
 
 “But it will all be honeymoon.”
 
 “I want you all to myself; for at least a little time. I won’t be
 selfish, but for a little while, just you and I....”
 
 He must have pleaded well, for though she made him no promise in words
 he knew she had answered “yes” by her eyes downcast, and breath that
 came a little quicker, by the clinging hands, by finding her in his
 arms, her undenying lips.
 
 
 
 
                               CHAPTER XII
 
 
 On Monday morning he went up to town without seeing her again. Tuesday
 he got that fateful telegram:
 
   Stevens seen man hanging about house, shabby peering man. Questioned
   cook. Sick with fear. Send back all my letters at once by special
   messenger. In panic. On no account come down or near me but letters
   urgent.
 
 Stevens had told her in the evening whilst putting her to bed. Stevens
 knew all about the case and was alert for possible complications. The
 shabby man had been under the observation of cook and housemaid.
 
 “And much satisfaction he got out of what they told him. Askin’
 questions an’ peerin’ about! Cook told him off, said no one hadn’t been
 stayin’ here, an’ if they had ’twas no business of his.”
 
 Margaret, pale and stricken, asked if the man looked like ... like a
 detective.
 
 “Lawyer’s clerk more like, but I thought I’d best let you know.”
 
 The news would have kept until the morning, but one could not expect a
 servant to take into consideration the effect her stories might have on
 Margaret’s sensitiveness. She had no sleep at all. Sleepless and shaken
 she lay awake the whole night, conjuring up ghosts, chiefly the ghost or
 vision of James, coarse-mouthed, cruel, vindictive. The bare idea of the
 case being reopened made her shudder, she had been so tormented in
 court, her modesties outraged. She knew she could never, would never
 bear it again. If the dreadful choice were all that was left to her she
 would give up Gabriel. At the thought of giving up Gabriel it seemed
 there was nothing else for which she cared, nothing on earth.
 
 She conjured up not only ghosts but absurdities. The shabby peering man
 would go to Hampstead, question Gabriel’s silly sister, _be shown
 letters_. This was more than she could bear. On the last occasion
 letters of hers had been read in court; love letters to James! She
 cringed in her bed at the remembrance of them. And what had she written
 to Gabriel? Not one word came back to her of anything she had written.
 At first she knew they had been laboured letters, laboured or literary.
 But since she had been down here, and Peter Kennedy, by sheer force of
 contrast, had taught her how much she could care for a really good and
 clever man, she had written with entire unrestraint, freely.
 
 She wrote that telegram to Gabriel Stanton at four o’clock in the
 morning, going down to the drawing-room for a telegram form in
 dressing-gown and slippers, her hair in two plaits, shivering with cold
 and apprehension. The house was full of eerie sounds; she heard pursuing
 feet. After she had secured the forms she rushed for the shelter of her
 room and the warmth of her bed; cowering under the clothes, not able for
 a long time to do the task she had set herself. When she became
 sufficiently rested she took more time and care over the wording of her
 telegram to Gabriel than she might have done over a sonnet. She wanted
 to say just enough, not too much, not to bring him down, yet to make the
 matter urgent. Stevens was rung for at six o’clock for tea and perhaps
 sympathy.
 
 “Get me a cup of tea as quickly as you can, I’ve been awake the whole
 night. I want this telegram sent off as soon as the office opens, not
 later anyway than eight o’clock. Keep the house as quiet as you can. I
 shall try and sleep now.”
 
 She slept until Gabriel’s telegram came back.
 
                   *       *       *       *       *
 
 One of our own men coming with package by 3.15.
 
                   *       *       *       *       *
 
 She met the train, looking pale and wretched. Stanton’s man wore the
 familiar cap. She had been to the office two or three times about the
 pottery book, and he recognised her easily.
 
 “You have a parcel for me?”
 
 “Mr. Gabriel said I was to tell you there was a letter inside.”
 
 “A letter! But I thought ... oh, yes! Give it to me.”
 
 “And I was to ask if there was an answer.”
 
 “An answer, but I can’t write here!”
 
 “He didn’t know you was meeting me. ‘Go up to the house,’ he said; ‘give
 it to her in her own hands. Ask if there is any answer.’”
 
 “Tell him ... tell him I’ll write,” she said vaguely.
 
 But as yet she had not read. What would he say, what comfort send her?
 For all her wired definiteness she wished he had come himself, had a
 moment’s disloyalty to him, thought he should have disregarded her
 wishes, rushed down, even if they had met only at the station. He need
 not have been so punctilious!
 
 She could not let the man go back until she had read and answered
 Gabriel’s letter. She made him drive back with her to Carbies, seated on
 the box beside the driver. She held the precious package tight, but did
 not open it. For that she must be alone.
 
 Stanton’s man was handed over to the household’s care for lunch or tea.
 He was to go back by the 5.5. “Mr. Gabriel” had given him his
 instructions.
 
 Now she was at her writing-table and alone. The packet was sealed with
 sealing-wax. Inside there were all her own letters, and a closed
 envelope superscribed in the dear familiar handwriting. She tore it
 open. After she had read her lover’s letter she had no more reproaches
 for him, vague or otherwise.
 
   _My Own, my Beloved:_—
 
   Here are the letters. I could refuse you nothing, but to part from
   these has overwhelmed me, weakened me. I have turned coward. For it
   is all so unknown. I am in the dark, bewildered. Your wire was an
   awful shock. I am haunted with terror, the harder to bear because it
   came in the midst of all the sweet sacred thoughts and remembrances
   of a wonderful week-end, of the things you said or allowed me to say
   which filled me with high hopes, promise of joy and happiness I
   dared hardly dwell upon. I don’t know what has happened. I only know
   you must not be alone and have forbidden me to come to you. Rescind
   your decision, I implore you. As I think and think with restless
   brain and heart my great ache and anxiety are that you are in
   trouble and that I am away and useless, just when I would give my
   soul for the chance of standing by you and with you in any need and
   for always. By all the remembrance of our happy hours, by all the
   new and sweet happiness you have given me, by all I yearn for in the
   future give me this chance. Let me come to you. To think of you
   suffering alone is maddening. Trust me, give me your trust, solemnly
   I swear not to fail you whatever may happen. It is of you only I am
   thinking. I can be strong for _you_, wise for _you_, and should
   thank God, both in pride and humbleness, for the chance to serve
   you; to serve you with reverence and love. _Send for me._ Tell
   me—let me share all and always.
 
                                                      Devotedly yours,
                                                                  G. S.
 
 She sat a long time with the letter in her hand, read it again and yet
 again. She forgot the night terrors, began to question herself. Of what
 had she been so frightened? What had Stevens told her? Only that a
 shabby man had questioned cook about their visitors. Now she wanted to
 analyse and sift the trouble, get to bedrock with it. She rang the bell
 and sent for the maids. They had singularly little to tell her;
 summarised it came to this: A shabby man had hung about Carbies all
 Monday; cook had called him up to the back door and asked him what he
 was after—“No good, I’ll be bound,” she told him. He had paid her a
 compliment and said that “with her in the kitchen it was no wonder men
 ’ung about.” And after that they seemed to have had something of a
 colloquy and cook had been asked if she walked out with anybody. “Like
 his nasty impidence,” she commented, when telling the story to her
 mistress. “I up and told him whether I walked out with anybody or not I
 wasn’t for the likes of him.”
 
 It was not without question and cross-question Margaret elicited that
 this final snub was not given until after tea. Cook defended the
 invitation.
 
 “It’s ’ard if in an establishment like this you can’t offer a young man
 a cup of tea.” She complained, not without waking a sympathetic echo in
 Margaret’s own heart, that Pineland was that dull, not a bit o’ life in
 it. Married men came round with the carts and a girl delivered the milk.
 
 “‘E was pleasant company enough till ’e started arskin’ questions.”
 
 Then it appeared it was Stevens who “gave him as good as he gave,”
 asking him what it was he did want to know, and being satirical with
 him. The housemaid had chimed in with Stevens; there may have been some
 little feminine jealousy at the back of it. Cook was young and
 frivolous, the two others more sedate. Stevens and the housemaid must
 have set upon cook and her presumed admirer. In any case the young man
 was given his congé immediately after tea, before he had established a
 footing. Stevens’ report had been exaggerated, Margaret’s terror
 excessive and unreasonable. She dismissed the erring cook now with the
 mildest of rebukes, then set herself to write to Gabriel. The time was
 limited, since the man was returning by the 5.5. She heard later, by the
 way, that he quite replaced the stranger in the cook’s facile
 affections. Stevens again was responsible for the statement that cook
 was “that light and talked away to any man.” Contrasting with herself,
 Stevens, who “didn’t ’old with making herself cheap.”
 
 Margaret wrote slowly, even if it were only a letter. She had to recall
 her mood, to analyse the panic. She was quite calm now. _His_ letter
 seemed exaggerated beyond what the occasion or the telegram demanded.
 
   _Dearest_:—
 
   How good you are, and safe. Your letter calmed and comforted me.
   Panic! no other word describes my condition at four o’clock this
   morning after a sleepless night. Servants’ gossip was at the bottom
   of it. I have always wished for a dumb maid, but Stevens’ tongue is
   hung on vibrating wires, never still. There _was_ a man, it seems
   now he was a suitor of cook’s! He _did_ ask questions, but chiefly
   as to her hours off duty, whether she was already “walking out,” an
   expression for an engagement on probation, I understand. He was an
   aspirant. I cannot write you a proper letter, my bad night has
   turned me into a wreck, a “beautiful ruin” as you would say. No, you
   wouldn’t, you are too polite. You must take it then that all is
   well; except that your choice has fallen upon a woman easily
   unnerved. Was I so foolish after all? James is capable of any
   blackguardism, he would hate that I should be happy with you. He can
   no longer excuse his conduct to me, or my resentment of it on the
   plea that I am unlike other women. I know his mind so well! “Women
   of genius have no sex,” he said among other things to account for
   the failure of our married life. He can say so no longer. “Women of
   genius have no sex!” _It isn’t true._ Do you see me reddening as I
   write it? What about that little house in Westminster? Have you
   written to all the agents? Are you searching? Sunday night I was so
   happy. One large room there must be. Colour prints on the walls and
   chintz on the big sofas, my Staffordshire everywhere, a shrine
   somewhere, central place for the musicians; cushions of all shades
   of roses, some a pale green. I can’t _see_ the carpets or curtains
   yet. I incline to dark green for both. No, I am not frivolous, only
   emotional. I think I shall alter when we are together, begin to
   develop and grow uniform in the hothouse of your love, under the
   forcing glass of your great regard. It is into that house, under
   that glass I want to creep, to be warmed through, to blossom.
 
   Picture me then as no longer unhappy or distressed, although all day
   I have neither worked nor played. Your letter healed me; take thanks
   for it therefore and come down Saturday as usual, with a plan of the
   house that is to be. (By the way, I _must_ have dog stoves.) In a
   few days now I, or you, will tell my father and stepmother. The days
   crawl, each one emptier than the other, until the one that brings
   you. _Arrivederci_.
 
 She sent it, but not the old ones back. She wanted to read them again,
 it would be an occupation for the evening. She would place them in
 order, together with his answers. She saw a story there. “The Love Tale
 of a Woman of Genius.” After all, both she and Gabriel were of
 sufficient interest for the world to wish to read about them. (It was
 not until a few days later, by the way, that the title was altered,
 others tried, that the disingenuous diary began, the MS. started.)
 
 She slept well that night and wrote him again in the morning, the most
 passionate love-letter of any of the series. Then she sent for Peter
 Kennedy. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday had to be got through. And then
 another week, and one other. And Safety, safety with Gabriel!
 
 Peter came hot-foot like a starving animal. It was five days since he
 had seen her, and he looked worn and cadaverous. She gave him an
 intermittent pulse to count, told him she had had a sleepless night,
 found herself restless, unnerved, told him no more. He was purely
 professional at first, brusquely uneasy about her, blaming her for all
 she had done and left undone, the tonic she had missed, the unrest to
 which she admitted. After that they found little more to say to each
 other, though Peter could not tear himself away.
 
 She talked best to Peter through the piano, as he to her. Even in these
 few weeks his playing had enormously improved. The whole man had
 altered. She had had more and different effect upon him than would have
 seemed possible at first. He had never been in love before, only known
 vulgar intrigue, how to repel the glad-eye attentions of provincial
 maidens to whom his size was an attraction, and his stupidity no
 deterrent. This was something altogether different, and in a measure he
 had grown to meet it, become more ambitious and less demonstrative,
 perceptibly humbler. She knew he loved her but made light of it. He
 filled up the hours until Gabriel would come again. That was all. But
 less amusingly now that she had less difficulty in managing him. This
 mutual attraction of music slurred over many weak places in their
 intercourse.
 
 Wednesday he sat through the afternoon, stayed on to dinner playing to
 her and listening. Thursday he paid her a professional visit in the
 morning, would have sounded her heart but that his stethoscope was
 unsteady, and he heard his own heartbeats louder and more definitely
 than hers. Thursday evening he ran up on his bicycle to see if she was
 all right. There was more music, and for all his newly found
 self-restraint a scene at parting, a scene that troubled her because she
 could not hold herself guiltless in bringing it about, and Gabriel was
 in her mind now to the exclusion of any other man. Gabriel had won
 solidly that which at first was little more than an incitement, an
 inclination.
 
 Gabriel Stanton would not have made love to another man’s fiancée. His
 standard was higher than her own, just as his scholarship was deeper and
 more profound. She was proud that he loved her, simpler and more sincere
 than she had ever been before.
 
 Tonight, when Peter Kennedy broke down, and cried at her feet and told
 her that his days were hell and all his nights sleepless, she was
 ashamed and distressed, much more repelled than attracted. She told him
 she would refuse to see him, that she would not have him at the house at
 all if he could not learn to behave himself.
 
 “You are a disgrace to your profession,” she said crossly, knowing she
 was not blameless.
 
 “You do not really think so, do you?” he asked. “I can’t help being in
 love with you.”
 
 “Yes, I do. You have given me a pain.”
 
 When she said that and pressed both hands over her heart his whole
 attitude changed. It was true that under the influence of his love his
 skill had developed. Her lips grew pale and her eyes frightened. He made
 her lie down, loosened her dress, gave her restoratives. The pain had
 been but slight, and she recovered rapidly.
 
 “It was entirely your fault,” she said when she was able to speak. “You
",Twilight
39," 
 “‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the
 point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy
 is quite essential—_absolute_ secrecy, you understand, and of course
 we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives
 in the bosom of his family.’
 
 “‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend
 upon my doing so.’
 
 “He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had
 never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
 
 “‘Do you promise, then?’ said he, at last.
 
 “‘Yes, I promise.’
 
 “‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference
 to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’
 
 “‘I have already given you my word.’
 
 “‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across
 the room, he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.
 
 “‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are
 sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in
 safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine, and began to stare at
 me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
 
 “A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to
 rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even
 my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my
 impatience.
 
 “‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of
 value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to
 my lips.
 
 “‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.
 
 “‘Most admirably.’
 
 “‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I
 simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has
 got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it
 right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’
 
 “‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’
 
 “‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’
 
 “‘Where to?’
 
 “‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of
 Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from
 Paddington which would bring you there at about 11.15.’
 
 “‘Very good.’
 
 “‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’
 
 “‘There is a drive, then?’
 
 “‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven
 miles from Eyford Station.’
 
 “‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would
 be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’
 
 “‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’
 
 “‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’
 
 “‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense
 you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and
 unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of
 your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of
 the business, there is plenty of time to do so.’
 
 “I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be
 to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate
 myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little
 more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’
 
 “‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have
 exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to
 commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I
 suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’
 
 “‘Entirely.’
 
 “‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that
 fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one
 or two places in England?’
 
 “‘I have heard so.’
 
 “‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small
 place—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover
 that there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On
 examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively
 small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones
 upon the right and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my
 neighbors. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land
 contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally,
 it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true
 value; but, unfortunately, I had no capital by which I could do this. I
 took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested
 that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit, and
 that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy
 the neighboring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and
 in order to help us in our operations we erected an hydraulic press.
 This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we
 wish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,
 however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers
 coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if
 the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
 fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise
 me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford
 to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’
 
 “‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not
 quite understand, was what use you could make of an hydraulic press
 in excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like
 gravel from a pit.’
 
 “‘Ah!’ said he, carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress
 the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what
 they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my
 confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’
 He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11.15.’
 
 “‘I shall certainly be there.’
 
 “‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last, long,
 questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he
 hurried from the room.
 
 “Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much
 astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had
 been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the
 fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price
 upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead
 to other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron
 had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that
 his explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the
 necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I
 should tell any one of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the
 winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,
 having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
 
 [Illustration: “‘NOT A WORD TO A SOUL’”]
 
 “At Reading I had to change not only my carriage, but my station.
 However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the
 little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger
 who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single
 sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,
 however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow
 upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me
 into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the
 windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as
 fast as the horse could go.”
 
 “One horse?” interjected Holmes.
 
 “Yes, only one.”
 
 “Did you observe the color?”
 
 “Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
 carriage. It was a chestnut.”
 
 “Tired-looking or fresh?”
 
 “Oh, fresh and glossy.”
 
 “Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most
 interesting statement.”
 
 “Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander
 Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from
 the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that
 it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the
 time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,
 that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem
 to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and
 jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of
 where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make
 out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now
 and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey,
 but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation
 soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged
 for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to
 a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after
 him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We
 stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so
 that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the
 house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed
 heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the
 carriage drove away.
 
 “It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about
 looking for matches, and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door
 opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light
 shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with
 a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face
 forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from
 the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that
 it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a
 tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
 gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from
 her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,
 and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he
 walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
 
 “‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few
 minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,
 plainly-furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which
 several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp
 on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you
 waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.
 
 “I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance
 of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the
 others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,
 hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak
 shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully
 silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the
 passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of
 uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and
 what were they doing, living in this strange, out-of-the-way place?
 And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was
 all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea.
 For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within
 that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it
 was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the
 country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath
 to keep up my spirits, and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my
 fifty-guinea fee.
 
 “Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter
 stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was
 standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the
 yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I
 could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a
 chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be
 silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her
 eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom
 behind her.
 
 “‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak
 calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you
 to do.’
 
 “‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot
 possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’
 
 “‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass
 through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and
 shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step
 forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she
 whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’
 
 “But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage
 in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my
 fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night
 which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should
 I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without
 the payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a
 monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had
 shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head, and
 declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew
 her entreaties, when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several
 footsteps were heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant,
 threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly
 and as noiselessly as she had come.
 
 “The new-comers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short, thick man with
 a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who
 was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
 
 “‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By-the-way, I
 was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear
 that you have felt the draught.’
 
 “‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself, because I felt
 the room to be a little close.’
 
 “He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better
 proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you
 up to see the machine.’
 
 “‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’
 
 “‘Oh no, it is in the house.’
 
 “‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’
 
 “‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All
 we wish you to do is to examine the machine, and to let us know what is
 wrong with it.’
 
 “We went up-stairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat
 manager, and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with
 corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,
 the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had
 crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture
 above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls,
 and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried
 to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten
 the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a
 keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and
 silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at
 least a fellow-countryman.
 
 “Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he
 unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us
 could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the
 colonel ushered me in.
 
 “‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it
 would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if any one were to
 turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the
 descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon
 this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside
 which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the
 manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but
 there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little
 of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to
 show us how we can set it right.’
 
 “I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.
 It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous
 pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers
 which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there
 was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through
 one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the
 india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk
 so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was
 clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my
 companions, who followed my remarks very carefully, and asked several
 practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When
 I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
 machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was
 obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest
 fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an
 engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of
 wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came
 to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I
 had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was, when I
 heard a muttered exclamation in German, and saw the cadaverous face of
 the colonel looking down at me.
 
 “‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.
 
 “I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that
 which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I
 think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if
 I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’
 
 “The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my
 speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his gray
 eyes.
 
 “‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took
 a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the
 lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite
 secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hello!’
 I yelled. ‘Hello! Colonel! Let me out!’
 
 “And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart
 into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the
 leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood
 upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its
 light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,
 jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which
 must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,
 screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I
 implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the
 levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my
 head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.
 Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
 very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face
 the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that
 dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve
 to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?
 Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which
 brought a gush of hope back to my heart.
 
 “I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls
 were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin
 line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and
 broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could
 hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.
 The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the
 other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the
 lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,
 told me how narrow had been my escape.
 
 “I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I
 found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a
 woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held
 a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had
 so foolishly rejected.
 
 “‘Come! come!’ she cried, breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.
 They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious
 time, but come!’
 
 “This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my
 feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The
 latter led to another broad passage, and, just as we reached it, we
 heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one
 answering the other, from the floor on which we were and from the one
 beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her
 wits’ end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through
 the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
 
 “‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that
 you can jump it.’
 
 “As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
 passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing
 forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s
 cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the
 window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden
 looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet
 down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I
 should have heard what passed between my savior and the ruffian who
 pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to
 go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my
 mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw
 her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
 
 “‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried, in English, ‘remember your promise after
 the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh,
 he will be silent!’
 
 “‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.
 ‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’
 He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with
 his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to
 the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip
 loosened, and I fell into the garden below.
 
 “I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
 rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood
 that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I
 ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at
 my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time,
 saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from
 my wound. I endeavored to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came
 a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint
 among the rose-bushes.
 
 “How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been
 a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
 breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,
 and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.
 The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my
 night’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I
 might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But, to my astonishment,
 when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen.
 I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high-road, and
 just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my
 approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the
 previous night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that
 had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
 
 “Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.
 There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter
 was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of
 him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was
 strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for
 me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was
 one about three miles off.
 
 “It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to
 wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It
 was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound
 dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I
 put the case into your hands, and shall do exactly what you advise.”
 
 We both sat in silence for some little time after, listening to this
 extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the
 shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his
 cuttings.
 
 “Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It
 appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost,
 on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, an hydraulic
 engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been
 heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the
 last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I
 fancy.”
 
 “Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl
 said.”
 
 “Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
 desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand
 in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will
 leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is
 precious, so if you feel equal to it, we shall go down to Scotland Yard
 at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.”
 
 Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,
 bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock
 Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,
 a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance
 map of the county out upon the seat, and was busy with his compasses
 drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.
 
 “There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten
 miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that
 line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”
 
 “It was an hour’s good drive.”
 
 “And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were
 unconscious?”
 
 “They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been
 lifted and conveyed somewhere.”
 
 “What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you
 when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain
 was softened by the woman’s entreaties.”
 
 “I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my
 life.”
 
 “Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have
 drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk
 that we are in search of are to be found.”
 
 “I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes, quietly.
 
 “Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!
 Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the
 country is more deserted there.”
 
 “And I say east,” said my patient.
 
 “I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several
 quiet little villages up there.”
 
 “And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and
 our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”
 
 “Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity
 of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your
 casting vote to?”
 
 “You are all wrong.”
 
 “But we can’t _all_ be.”
 
 “Oh yes, you can. This is my point;” he placed his finger in the centre
 of the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”
 
 “But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.
 
 “Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse
 was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had
 gone twelve miles over heavy roads?”
 
 “Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet,
 thoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this
 gang.”
 
 “None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and
 have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of
 silver.”
 
 “We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the
 inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We
 even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they
 had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old
 hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got
 them right enough.”
 
 But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined
 to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we
 saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small
 clump of trees in the neighborhood, and hung like an immense ostrich
 feather over the landscape.
 
 “A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet, as the train steamed off again on
 its way.
 
 “Yes, sir!” said the station-master.
 
 “When did it break out?”
 
 “I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and
 the whole place is in a blaze.”
 
 “Whose house is it?”
 
 “Dr. Becher’s.”
 
 “Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin,
 with a long, sharp nose?”
 
 The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
 Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined
 waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as
 I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good
 Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”
 
 The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
 hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill,
 and there was a great wide-spread whitewashed building in front of us,
 spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front
 three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.
 
 “That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the
 gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second
 window is the one that I jumped from.”
 
 “Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.
 There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was
",Holmes
40," with.”
 
 As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his
 companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money
 should be heard without. When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the
 coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much
 satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:
 
 “Carry your memory back—let me see—twelve years, last winter.”
 
 “It’s a long time,” said Mr. Bumble. “Very good. I’ve done it.”
 
 “The scene, the workhouse.”
 
 “Good!”
 
 “And the time, night.”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable
 drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to
 themselves—gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and
 hid their shame, rot ’em in the grave!”
 
 “The lying-in room, I suppose?” said Mr. Bumble, not quite following
 the stranger’s excited description.
 
 “Yes,” said the stranger. “A boy was born there.”
 
 “A many boys,” observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.
 
 “A murrain on the young devils!” cried the stranger; “I speak of one; a
 meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a
 coffin-maker—I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in
 it—and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.
 
 “Why, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!” said Mr. Bumble; “I remember him,
 of course. There wasn’t a obstinater young rascal—”
 
 “It’s not of him I want to hear; I’ve heard enough of him,” said the
 stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject
 of poor Oliver’s vices. “It’s of a woman; the hag that nursed his
 mother. Where is she?”
 
 “Where is she?” said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered
 facetious. “It would be hard to tell. There’s no midwifery there,
 whichever place she’s gone to; so I suppose she’s out of employment,
 anyway.”
 
 “What do you mean?” demanded the stranger, sternly.
 
 “That she died last winter,” rejoined Mr. Bumble.
 
 The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and
 although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his
 gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in
 thought. For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be
 relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed
 more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great
 matter. With that he rose, as if to depart.
 
 But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an
 opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in
 the possession of his better half. He well remembered the night of old
 Sally’s death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good
 reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs.
 Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure
 of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know
 that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman’s
 attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.
 Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger,
 with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old
 harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason
 to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.
 
 “How can I find her?” said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and
 plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused
 afresh by the intelligence.
 
 “Only through me,” rejoined Mr. Bumble.
 
 “When?” cried the stranger, hastily.
 
 “To-morrow,” rejoined Bumble.
 
 “At nine in the evening,” said the stranger, producing a scrap of
 paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side,
 in characters that betrayed his agitation; “at nine in the evening,
 bring her to me there. I needn’t tell you to be secret. It’s your
 interest.”
 
 With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for
 the liquor that had been drunk. Shortly remarking that their roads were
 different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic
 repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.
 
 On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it
 contained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him
 to ask it.
 
 “What do you want?” cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble
 touched him on the arm. “Following me?”
 
 “Only to ask a question,” said the other, pointing to the scrap of
 paper. “What name am I to ask for?”
 
 “Monks!” rejoined the man; and strode hastily away.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXVIII.
 CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND
 MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW
 
 
 It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had
 been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of
 vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a
 violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the
 main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered
 little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half,
 or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon
 the river.
 
 They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might,
 perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the
 rain, and sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a
 lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few
 paces in front, as though—the way being dirty—to give his wife the
 benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound
 silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned
 his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then,
 discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of
 walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards
 their place of destination.
 
 This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long
 been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under
 various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on
 plunder and crime. It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily
 built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled
 together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for
 the most part, within a few feet of the river’s bank. A few leaky boats
 drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it:
 and here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to
 indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some
 avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless
 condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by,
 without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed
 there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view
 to their being actually employed.
 
 In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its
 upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a
 manufactory of some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished
 employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. But it had
 long since gone to ruin. The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp,
 had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable
 portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the
 remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a
 favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving
 itself in the same fate.
 
 It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as
 the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain
 commenced pouring violently down.
 
 “The place should be somewhere here,” said Bumble, consulting a scrap
 of paper he held in his hand.
 
 “Halloa there!” cried a voice from above.
 
 Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man
 looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.
 
 “Stand still, a minute,” cried the voice; “I’ll be with you directly.”
 With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.
 
 “Is that the man?” asked Mr. Bumble’s good lady.
 
 Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.
 
 “Then, mind what I told you,” said the matron: “and be careful to say
 as little as you can, or you’ll betray us at once.”
 
 Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was
 apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of
 proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was
 prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near
 which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.
 
 “Come in!” he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.
 “Don’t keep me here!”
 
 The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any
 other invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind,
 followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that
 remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.
 
 “What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?” said
 Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the
 door behind them.
 
 “We—we were only cooling ourselves,” stammered Bumble, looking
 apprehensively about him.
 
 “Cooling yourselves!” retorted Monks. “Not all the rain that ever fell,
 or ever will fall, will put as much of hell’s fire out, as a man can
 carry about with him. You won’t cool yourself so easily; don’t think
 it!”
 
 With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and
 bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was
 fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.
 
 “This is the woman, is it?” demanded Monks.
 
 “Hem! That is the woman,” replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife’s
 caution.
 
 “You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?” said the matron,
 interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.
 
 “I know they will always keep _one_ till it’s found out,” said Monks.
 
 “And what may that be?” asked the matron.
 
 “The loss of their own good name,” replied Monks. “So, by the same
 rule, if a woman’s a party to a secret that might hang or transport
 her, I’m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you
 understand, mistress?”
 
 “No,” rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.
 
 “Of course you don’t!” said Monks. “How should you?”
 
 Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two
 companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened
 across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the
 roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder,
 leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of
 lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed,
 which shook the crazy building to its centre.
 
 “Hear it!” he cried, shrinking back. “Hear it! Rolling and crashing on
 as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding
 from it. I hate the sound!”
 
 He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands
 suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr.
 Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.
 
 “These fits come over me, now and then,” said Monks, observing his
 alarm; “and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don’t mind me now; it’s
 all over for this once.”
 
 Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the
 window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which
 hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy
 beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and
 three chairs that were placed beneath it.
 
 “Now,” said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, “the
 sooner we come to our business, the better for all. The woman know what
 it is, does she?”
 
 The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the
 reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.
 
 “He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died;
 and that she told you something—”
 
 “About the mother of the boy you named,” replied the matron
 interrupting him. “Yes.”
 
 “The first question is, of what nature was her communication?” said
 Monks.
 
 “That’s the second,” observed the woman with much deliberation. “The
 first is, what may the communication be worth?”
 
 “Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?”
 asked Monks.
 
 “Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,” answered Mrs. Bumble: who did
 not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.
 
 “Humph!” said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry;
 “there may be money’s worth to get, eh?”
 
 “Perhaps there may,” was the composed reply.
 
 “Something that was taken from her,” said Monks. “Something that she
 wore. Something that—”
 
 “You had better bid,” interrupted Mrs. Bumble. “I have heard enough,
 already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.”
 
 Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any
 greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened
 to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he
 directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised
 astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded,
 what sum was required for the disclosure.
 
 “What’s it worth to you?” asked the woman, as collectedly as before.
 
 “It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,” replied Monks. “Speak
 out, and let me know which.”
 
 “Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty
 pounds in gold,” said the woman; “and I’ll tell you all I know. Not
 before.”
 
 “Five-and-twenty pounds!” exclaimed Monks, drawing back.
 
 “I spoke as plainly as I could,” replied Mrs. Bumble. “It’s not a large
 sum, either.”
 
 “Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it’s
 told!” cried Monks impatiently; “and which has been lying dead for
 twelve years past or more!”
 
 “Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value
 in course of time,” answered the matron, still preserving the resolute
 indifference she had assumed. “As to lying dead, there are those who
 will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for
 anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!”
 
 “What if I pay it for nothing?” asked Monks, hesitating.
 
 “You can easily take it away again,” replied the matron. “I am but a
 woman; alone here; and unprotected.”
 
 “Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,” submitted Mr. Bumble,
 in a voice tremulous with fear: “_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,”
 said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, “Mr. Monks is too
 much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr.
 Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a
 little run to seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd: I say I have no
 doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined
 officer, with very uncommon strength, if I’m once roused. I only want a
 little rousing; that’s all.”
 
 As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern
 with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed
 expression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and
 not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless,
 indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for
 the purpose.
 
 “You are a fool,” said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; “and had better hold your
 tongue.”
 
 “He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can’t speak in a
 lower tone,” said Monks, grimly. “So! He’s your husband, eh?”
 
 “He my husband!” tittered the matron, parrying the question.
 
 “I thought as much, when you came in,” rejoined Monks, marking the
 angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. “So much
 the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I
 find that there’s only one will between them. I’m in earnest. See
 here!”
 
 He thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told
 out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the
 woman.
 
 “Now,” he said, “gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder,
 which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let’s
 hear your story.”
 
 The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break
 almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from
 the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say. The
 faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small
 table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to
 render her whisper audible. The sickly rays of the suspended lantern
 falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of
 their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness,
 looked ghastly in the extreme.
 
 “When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,” the matron began,
 “she and I were alone.”
 
 “Was there no one by?” asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; “No
 sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and
 might, by possibility, understand?”
 
 “Not a soul,” replied the woman; “we were alone. _I_ stood alone beside
 the body when death came over it.”
 
 “Good,” said Monks, regarding her attentively. “Go on.”
 
 “She spoke of a young creature,” resumed the matron, “who had brought a
 child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room,
 but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.”
 
 “Ay?” said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder,
 “Blood! How things come about!”
 
 “The child was the one you named to him last night,” said the matron,
 nodding carelessly towards her husband; “the mother this nurse had
 robbed.”
 
 “In life?” asked Monks.
 
 “In death,” replied the woman, with something like a shudder. “She
 stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the
 dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the
 infant’s sake.”
 
 “She sold it,” cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; “did she sell it?
 Where? When? To whom? How long before?”
 
 “As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,” said
 the matron, “she fell back and died.”
 
 “Without saying more?” cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very
 suppression, seemed only the more furious. “It’s a lie! I’ll not be
 played with. She said more. I’ll tear the life out of you both, but
 I’ll know what it was.”
 
 “She didn’t utter another word,” said the woman, to all appearance
 unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man’s
 violence; “but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which
 was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the
 hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.”
 
 “Which contained—” interposed Monks, stretching forward.
 
 “Nothing,” replied the woman; “it was a pawnbroker’s duplicate.”
 
 “For what?” demanded Monks.
 
 “In good time I’ll tell you.” said the woman. “I judge that she had
 kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better
 account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together
 money to pay the pawnbroker’s interest year by year, and prevent its
 running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be
 redeemed. Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the
 scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand. The time was out in
 two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so
 redeemed the pledge.”
 
 “Where is it now?” asked Monks quickly.
 
 “_There_,” replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she
 hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for
 a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling
 hands. It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of
 hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.
 
 “It has the word ‘Agnes’ engraved on the inside,” said the woman.
 
 “There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date;
 which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.”
 
 “And this is all?” said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the
 contents of the little packet.
 
 “All,” replied the woman.
 
 Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the
 story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty
 pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration
 which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of
 the previous dialogue.
 
 “I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,” said his
 wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; “and I want to know
 nothing; for it’s safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?”
 
 “You may ask,” said Monks, with some show of surprise; “but whether I
 answer or not is another question.”
 
 “—Which makes three,” observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of
 facetiousness.
 
 “Is that what you expected to get from me?” demanded the matron.
 
 “It is,” replied Monks. “The other question?”
 
 “What do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?”
 
 “Never,” rejoined Monks; “nor against me either. See here! But don’t
 move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.”
 
 With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an
 iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened
 close at Mr. Bumble’s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several
 paces backward, with great precipitation.
 
 “Look down,” said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. “Don’t
 fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were
 seated over it, if that had been my game.”
 
 Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble
 himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid
 water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all
 other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against
 the green and slimy piles. There had once been a water-mill beneath;
 the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments
 of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new
 impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted
 to stem its headlong course.
 
 “If you flung a man’s body down there, where would it be to-morrow
 morning?” said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.
 
 “Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,” replied
 Bumble, recoiling at the thought.
 
 Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly
 thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of
 some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It
 fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely
 audible splash; and was gone.
 
 The three looking into each other’s faces, seemed to breathe more
 freely.
 
 “There!” said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back
 into its former position. “If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books
 say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash
 among it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant
 party.”
 
 “By all means,” observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.
 
 “You’ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?” said Monks, with a
 threatening look. “I am not afraid of your wife.”
 
 “You may depend upon me, young man,” answered Mr. Bumble, bowing
 himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. “On
 everybody’s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.”
 
 “I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,” remarked Monks. “Light your
 lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.”
 
 It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr.
 Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would
 infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his
 lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now
 carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse,
 descended in silence, followed by his wife. Monks brought up the rear,
 after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other
 sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the
 rushing of the water.
 
 They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks
 started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot
 above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a
 marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking
 nervously about him for hidden trap-doors. The gate at which they had
 entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a
 nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into
 the wet and darkness outside.
 
 They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an
 invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been
 hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he
 returned to the chamber he had just quitted.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XXXIX.
 INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY
 ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS
 TOGETHER
 
 
 On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned
 in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as
 therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily
 growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.
 
 The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of
 those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it
 was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great
 distance from his former lodgings. It was not, in appearance, so
 desirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and
 badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one
 small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty
 lane. Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman’s
 having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of
 furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the
 disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen,
 bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated
 condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these
 symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.
 
 The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat,
 by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree
 improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled
 nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week’s growth. The dog sat at
 the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now
 pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the
 street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.
 Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which
 formed a portion of the robber’s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale
 and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been
 considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has
 already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to
 Mr. Sikes’s question.
 
 “Not long gone seven,” said the girl. “How do you feel to-night, Bill?”
 
 “As weak as water,” replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes
 and limbs. “Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering
 bed anyhow.”
 
 Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes’s temper; for, as the girl raised
 him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her
 awkwardness, and struck her.
 
 “Whining are you?” said Sikes. “Come! Don’t stand snivelling there. If
 you can’t do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D’ye hear
 me?”
 
 “I hear you,” replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a
 laugh. “What fancy have you got in your head now?”
 
 “Oh! you’ve thought better of it, have you?” growled Sikes, marking the
 tear which trembled in her eye. “All the better for you, you have.”
 
 “Why, you don’t mean to say, you’d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,”
 said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.
 
 “No!” cried Mr. Sikes. “Why not?”
 
 “Such a number of nights,” said the girl, with a touch of woman’s
 tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even
 to her voice: “such a number of nights as I’ve been patient with you,
 nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the
 first that I’ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn’t have served me as
 you did just now, if you’d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say
 you wouldn’t.”
 
 “Well, then,” rejoined Mr. Sikes, “I wouldn’t. Why, damme, now, the
 girls’s whining again!”
 
 “It’s nothing,” said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. “Don’t
 you seem to mind me. It’ll soon be over.”
 
 “What’ll be over?” demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. “What foolery
 are you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don’t come over
 me with your woman’s nonsense.”
 
 At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was
 delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really
 weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and
 fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths
 with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his
 threats. Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon
 emergency; for Miss Nancy’s hysterics were usually of that violent kind
 which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance;
 Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment
 wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.
 
 “What’s the matter here, my dear?” said Fagin, looking in.
 
 “Lend a hand to the girl, can’t you?” replied Sikes impatiently. “Don’t
 stand chattering and grinning at me!”
 
 With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl’s
 assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who
 had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on
 the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from
 the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked
 it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents
 down the patient’s throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to
 prevent mistakes.
 
 “Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,” said Mr.
 Dawkins; “and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the
 petticuts.”
 
 These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially
 that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his
 share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not
 long in producing the desired effect. The girl gradually recovered her
 senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon
 the pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some
 astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.
 
 “Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?” he asked Fagin.
 
 “No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and
 I’ve brought something good with me, that you’ll be glad to see.
 Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that
 we spent all our money on, this morning.”
 
 In compliance with Mr. Fagin’s request, the Artful untied this bundle,
 which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed
 the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed
 them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and
 excellence.
 
 “Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,” exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing
 to view a huge pasty; “sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender
 limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there’s no
 occasion to pick ’em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so
 precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it’ll go nigh to
 blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that
 the niggers didn’t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a
 pitch of goodness,—oh no! Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh;
 piece of double Glo’ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort
 you ever lushed!”
 
 Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his
 extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while
 Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw
 spirits from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his
 throat without a moment’s hesitation.
 
 “Ah!” said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. “You’ll
 do, Bill; you’ll do now.”
 
 “Do!” exclaimed Mr. Sikes; “I might have been done for, twenty times
 over, afore you’d have done anything to help me. What do you mean by
 leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted
 wagabond?”
 
 “Only hear him, boys!” said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. “And us
 come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.”
 
 “The things is well enough in their way,” observed Mr. Sikes: a little
 soothed as he glanced over the table; “but what have you got to say for
 yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health,
 blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this
 mortal time, than if I was that ’ere dog.—Drive him down, Charley!”
 
 “I never see such a jolly dog as that,” cried Master Bates, doing as he
 was desired. “Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He’d
 make his fortun’ on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma
 besides.”
 
 “Hold your din,” cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still
 growling angrily. “What have you got to say for yourself, you withered
 old fence, eh?”
 
 “I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,” replied
 the Jew.
 
 “And what about the other fortnight?” demanded Sikes. “What about the
 other fortnight that you’ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his
 hole?”
 
 “I couldn’t help it, Bill. I can’t go into a long explanation before
 company; but I couldn’t help it, upon my honour.”
 
 “Upon your what?” growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. “Here! Cut me
 off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out
 of my mouth, or it’ll choke me dead.”
 
 “Don’t be out of temper, my dear,” urged Fagin, submissively. “I have
 never forgot you, Bill; never once.”
 
 “No! I’ll pound it that you han’t,” replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.
 “You’ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid
 shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do
 that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well:
 and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn’t been for the
 girl, I might have died.”
 
 “There now, Bill,” remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.
 “If it hadn’t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means
 of your having such a handy girl about you?”
 
 “He says true enough there!” said Nancy, coming hastily forward. “Let
 him be; let him be.”
 
 Nancy’s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,
 receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with
 liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin,
 assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a
 better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant
 banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough
 jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he
 condescended to make.
 
 “It’s all very well,” said Mr. Sikes; “but I must have some blunt from
 you to-night.”
 
 “I haven’t a piece of coin about me,” replied the Jew.
 
 “Then you’ve got lots at home,” retorted Sikes; “and I must have some
 from there.”
 
 “Lots!” cried Fagin, holding up is hands. “I haven’t so much as would—”
 
 “I don’t know how much you’ve got, and I dare say you hardly know
 yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,” said Sikes;
 “but I must have some to-night; and that’s flat.”
 
 “Well, well,” said Fagin, with a sigh, “I’ll send the Artful round
 presently.”
 
 “You won’t do nothing of the kind,” rejoined Mr. Sikes. “The Artful’s a
 deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get
 dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you
 put him up to it. Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all
 sure; and I’ll lie down and have a snooze while she’s gone.”
 
 After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the
 amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four
 and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would
 only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly
 remarking that if he couldn’t get any more he must accompany him home;
 with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The
 Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,
 attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself
 on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the
 young lady’s return.
 
 In due course, they arrived at Fagin’s abode, where they found Toby
 Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage,
 which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and
 with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his
 young friends. Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found
 relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and
 mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat
 to go.
 
 “Has nobody been, Toby?” asked Fagin.
 
 “Not a living leg,” answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; “it’s
 been as dull as swipes. You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin,
 to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I’m as flat as a
 juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn’t
 had the good natur’ to amuse this youngster. Horrid dull, I’m blessed
 if I an’t!”
 
 With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit
 swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with
 a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly
 beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he
 swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that
 Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots
 till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his
 acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he
 didn’t value his losses the snap of his little finger.
 
 “Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!” said Master Bates, highly amused by this
 declaration.
 
 “Not a bit of it,” replied Mr. Chitling. “Am I, Fagin?”
 
 “A very clever fellow, my dear,” said Fagin, patting him on the
 shoulder, and winking to his other pupils.
 
 “And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an’t he, Fagin?” asked Tom.
 
 “No doubt at all of that, my dear.”
 
 “And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an’t it,
 Fagin?” pursued Tom.
 
 “Very much so, indeed, my dear. They’re only jealous, Tom, because he
 won’t give it to them.”
 
 “Ah!” cried Tom, triumphantly, “that’s where it is! He has cleaned me
 out. But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can’t I, Fagin?”
 
 “To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up
 your loss at once, and don’t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley! It’s
 time you were on the lay. Come! It’s near ten, and nothing done yet.”
 
 In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their
 hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging,
 as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in
 whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very
 conspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as there are a great number of
 spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.
 Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine
 gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their
 reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.
 
 “Now,” said Fagin, when they had left the room, “I’ll go and get you
 that cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where I
 keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money,
 for I’ve got none to lock up, my dear—ha! ha! ha!—none to lock up. It’s
 a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I’m fond of seeing the young
 people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!” he said,
 hastily concealing the key in his breast; “who’s that? Listen!”
 
 The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared
 in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person,
 whoever he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man’s voice reached
 her ears. The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and
 shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table.
 The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint
 of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably,
 with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had
 been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time.
 
 “Bah!” he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; “it’s the
 man I expected before; he’s coming downstairs. Not a word about the
 money while he’s here, Nance. He won’t stop long. Not ten minutes, my
 dear.”
 
 Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to
 the door, as a man’s step was heard upon the stairs without. He reached
 it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the
 room, was close upon the girl before he observed her.
 
 It was Monks.
 
 “Only one of my young people,” said Fagin, observing that Monks drew
 back, on beholding a stranger. “Don’t move, Nancy.”
 
 The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of
 careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she
 stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if
 there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly
 have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.
 
 “Any news?” inquired Fagin.
 
 “Great.”
 
 “And—and—good?” asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the
 other man by being too sanguine.
 
 “Not bad, any way,” replied Monks with a smile. “I have been prompt
 enough this time. Let me have a word with you.”
 
 The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room,
 although she could see that Monks was pointing to her. The Jew: perhaps
 fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he
 endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of
 the room.
 
 “Not that infernal hole we were in before,” she could hear the man say
 as they went upstairs. Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did
 not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his
 companion to the second story.
 
 Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the
 house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely
 over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door,
 listening with breathless interest. The moment the noise ceased, she
 glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and
 silence; and was lost in the gloom above.
 
 The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl
",OliverTwist
41," She was a little sorry for him, and to show it reproached him more.
 
 “Why do you do it, then? You know that, as far as I can be, I am engaged
 to Gabriel Stanton, that the moment the decree is made absolute we shall
 be married. Perhaps I ought not to have let you come so often....”
 
 “I fell in love with you the very first moment I saw you. If I’d never
 seen you again it would have been the same thing. And you’ve nothing to
 reproach yourself with. You’ve made a different man of me. I play
 better.”
 
 “And your taste in music has improved.” He looked so forlorn standing up
 and saying he played the piano better since he had known her, that she
 regretted the cruelty of her words. He had relieved her pain not once
 but many times. Instead of sending him away, as she had intended, she
 kept him with her until quite late. She let him tell her about himself;
 and what a change his love for her had brought into his life, and there
 was nothing he would not do, nor sacrifice for her. He said, humbly
 enough, that he knew she could never, never have cared for such a man as
 himself.
 
 “Stanton has been to a public school and university, is no end of a
 swell at classics. I got what little education I have at St. Paul’s and
 the London University, walked the hospitals and thought well of myself
 for doing it, that I was coming up in the world. My father was a country
 dentist. I’ve studied more, learnt more since you’ve been here than in
 all my student days. You’ve opened a new world to me. I didn’t know
 there were women like you. After the girls I’ve met! You were such a ...
 lady, and all that. You are so clever too, and satirical, I don’t mind
 you being down on me. It isn’t as if you were strong.”
 
 She smiled and asked him whether her delicacy was an additional charm.
 
 “Well, yes, in a way it is. I can always bring you round. I want you to
 go on letting me be your doctor. You hardly had that pain a minute
 tonight. It is angina, you know, genuine _angina pectoris_, and I can do
 no end of things for it.”
 
 “You don’t mean I must always have these pains, that they will grow
 worse?” She grew pale and he saw he had made a mistake, hastening to
 reassure her.
 
 “You’ve only got to live quietly, take things easily.”
 
 “Oh, that will be all right. When I am married everything will be easy,”
 she said almost complacently. And then in plaintive explanation or
 apology added, “I bear pain so badly.”
 
 “And I may go on doctoring you?”
 
 “I don’t suppose I shall send to Pineland if I should feel not quite
 well,” she answered seriously. “We are going to live in London.”
 
 “I’ll come up to London. There is no difficulty about that. I’ve started
 reading for my M.D. I can get back to my old hospital.” She rallied him
 a little and then sent him away.
 
 “I shall expect to hear you are house physician when I return from my
 honeymoon!”
 
 “May I come up in the morning? I want to hear that attack has not
 recurred.”
 
 “The morning is a long way off, the night has to be got through first.”
 Suddenly she remembered her panic and had a faint recrudescence of fear.
 “I’ve so many things on my mind. I wish you could ensure me a good
 night.”
 
 “But I can,” he said eagerly. “I can easily.”
 
 “And without after-effects?”
 
 “Without any bad after-effects.”
 
 “The bromide! but it always makes me feel dull and stupid.”
 
 “Veronal?”
 
 “I am frightened of veronal.”
 
 “Adolin, paraldehyde, trional, a small injection of morphia?”
 
 “But it is so late. You would have to get anything from a chemist.”
 
 “No, I shouldn’t. I’ve got my case.”
 
 “Your case!”
 
 “Yes.” He showed it to her, full of strange little bottles and unknown
 drugs. She showed interest, asking what was this or the other, then
 changing her mind suddenly:
 
 “No, I won’t try any experiments. I’ll sleep, or I’ll stay awake.”
 
 “You don’t trust me?”
 
 “Indeed I do, but I distrust drugs. Unless I am in pain, then I would
 take anything. Tell me, can you really always help me if I get into
 pain? Would you? At any risk?”
 
 “At any risk to myself, not at any risk to you. But we won’t talk of
 pain, it mustn’t happen.”
 
 “But if it did?” she persisted.
 
 “Don’t fear, I couldn’t see you in pain.”
 
 “Yet I’ve always heard and sometimes seen how callous doctors are.”
 
 “But I’m not only a doctor....”
 
 “Hush! I thought we had agreed you were. My very good and concerned
 doctor. Now you really must go. Yes, you can come up in the morning.”
 
 “You will take your bromide?”
 
 “If I need it. Good-night!”
 
 Margaret slept well. But she heard from Stevens again next morning over
 her toilette that cook was not to be trusted, should be got rid of, that
 she was deceitful, had been seen, after all, with the shabby man from
 London.
 
 “She took her oath that she’d never mentioned you to him, you nor your
 visitors, only Dr. Kennedy who attends you. But I’d not believe her
 oath. A hat with feathers she had on, and a ring on her finger when she
 went out with him. Such goings-on are not fit for a respectable
 Christian house, and so I told her.”
 
 Margaret listened inattentively, and irritably. She did not want ever to
 think again of that shabby man or her own unreasoned fears. She bade the
 maid be silent, attend to her duties. Stevens sniffed and grumbled under
 her breath. Afterwards she asked if the doctor were coming up again this
 morning.
 
 “Why?”
 
 “He might want to sound you. You’d best have your Valenciennes slip.”
 
 “Don’t be so absurd.”
 
 Nevertheless the query set her thinking of Peter Kennedy and his love
 for her. Desultory thinking connects itself naturally with a leisurely
 toilette. She was sorry for Peter and composed phrases for him,
 comforting noncommittal phrases. She thought it would do him good to get
 to London, his ideas wanted expanding, his provincialisms brushed off.
 She was under the impression she would do great things for Peter one
 day, let him into her circle; that salon she and Gabriel would hold. Her
 father should consult him, she would help him to build up a practice.
 
 When he came up, later on, she told him something of her good
 intentions. They did not interest him very much, it was not service he
 wanted from her. He heard her night had been good, that she felt rested
 and better this morning. He had not been told what had disturbed the
 last one. They were sitting together in the drawing-room, doctor and
 patient, when the parlourmaid came in with a card. Margaret looked at it
 and laughed, passed it over to him.
 
 “That’s Anne,” she said. “Anne evidently thinks I am a hopeful subject.”
 
 The card bore the name of “Mrs. Roope, Christian Healer.”
 
 “Stay and see her with me,” she said to Peter. “It will be almost like a
 consultation, won’t it?... Yes,” she told the parlourmaid, “I will see
 the lady. Let her come up. Now, Peter Kennedy, is opportunity to show
 your quality, your tact. I expect to be amused, I want to be amused.”
 
 Peter was not loath to stay, whatever the excuse.
 
 Mrs. Roope, tall, and dressed something like a hospital nurse, in long
 flowing cloak and bonnet with veil, was ushered in, but delayed a little
 in her greeting, because that hysterical affection of the throat of
 which Anne had spoken, caught and held her, and at first she could only
 make uncanny noises, something between a hiccough and a bad stammer.
 
 “I’ve come to see you,” she said not once but several times without
 getting any further.
 
 “Sit down,” Margaret said good-naturedly. “This is my doctor. I would
 suggest you ask him to cure your affliction, only I understand you
 prefer your own methods.”
 
 “There is nothing the matter with me,” said the Christian Scientist with
 an unavoidable contortion.
 
 “So I see,” said Margaret, her eyes sparkling with humour.
 
 “I would prefer that this interview should take place without
 witnesses.”
 
 Margaret found that a little surprising, but even then she was not
 disturbed. There was no connection in her mind between Anne Stanton’s
 healer and the shabby man who had wooed her cook.
 
 “I have no secrets from this gentleman,” she answered, her eyes still
 laughing. “He has no prejudice against you irregular practitioners. You
 can decide together what is to be done for me. He is my present
 physician.”
 
 “I had thought he was”—bupp, bupp, explosion—“your co-respondent.”
 
 When she said that Peter Kennedy looked up. He tingled all over and his
 forehead flushed. He made a step forward and then stood still. His
 instinct told him here was an enemy, an enemy of Margaret’s. He looked,
 too, at Margaret.
 
 “Your name is Gabriel Stanton.”
 
 “My name is Peter Kennedy.”
 
 Margaret’s quick mind leapt to the truth, saw, and foresaw what was
 coming. She turned very pale, as if she had been struck. Peter Kennedy
 moved nearer to her.
 
 “Shall I turn her out?” he asked.
 
 Mrs. Roope fanned herself with her bonnet strings as if she had said
 nothing unusual.
 
 “You had better see me alone,” she said, not menacingly but as if she
 had established her point. To save repetition the rest of her
 conversation can be recorded without the affliction that retarded it.
 
 “No,” Margaret answered, her courage at low ebb. “Stay where you are,”
 she said to Peter Kennedy.
 
 “You don’t suppose I am going, do you?” he asked. Mrs. Roope, after a
 glance, ignored him.
 
 “Perhaps you are not aware that you have been under observation for some
 time. My call on you is one of kindness, of kindness only. James Capel
 is my husband’s cousin.”
 
 At the name of James Capel Margaret gave a little low cry and Peter
 Kennedy sat down by her side, abruptly.
 
 “We heard you were being visited by Gabriel Stanton and a watch was set
 upon you. Your decree is not yet made absolute. It never will be now, if
 the King’s Proctor is informed. James, I know, does not wish for a
 divorce from you.”
 
 Margaret sat very still and speechless,—any movement, she knew, might
 bring on that sickening pain. Peter too realised the position, although
 he had so little to guide him.
 
 “Answer her. Don’t let her think you are afraid. It’s blackmail she’s
 after. I am sure of it,” he whispered to his patient. Thus strengthened
 Margaret made an effort for self-control. Peter saw then that the fear
 was not as new to her as it was to him.
 
 “So it is you who have been having this house watched? Is it perhaps
 your husband who has been making love to my cook?” Since Peter Kennedy
 was here she would not show the cold fear at her heart. Mrs. Roope was
 not offended. She had been kicked out of too many houses by irate
 fathers, brothers, and husbands to be sensitive.
 
 “No, that is not my husband. The gentleman who has been here is my
 nephew. As for making love to your cook, I will not admit it. I
 suggested your maid.”
 
 “If she had only sent her husband instead of coming herself. One can
 talk to a man.”
 
 Peter might have been talking to himself. He had risen and now was
 walking about the room on soft-balled feet like a captive panther.
 
 “You don’t know our religion, our creed. We have the true Christian
 spirit and desire to help others. The sensual cannot be made the
 mouthpiece of the spiritual. Sensuality palsies the right hand and
 causes the left to let go its divine grasp. That is why I interfere, for
 your own good as we are enjoined. Uncleanliness must lead to the body’s
 hurt, in so far as it can be hurt. But mind and matter being one, what
 hurts the one will hurt the other.”
 
 “You can cut the cackle and come to the horses,” Peter interrupted
 rudely. He had summed up the situation and thought he might control it.
 To him it was obvious the woman was a common blackmailer, although she
 had formulated no terms. “You are making a great deal of the fact that
 Mr. Stanton has been down here two or three times. I suppose you know he
 is Mrs. Capel’s publisher.”
 
 “Do not interfere, young man. You are a member of a mendacious
 profession. I am not here to speak to you. I know Gabriel Stanton slept
 in the house,” she said to Margaret.
 
 “What then? Show us your foul mind, if you dare.”
 
 “There is no mind....”
 
 “Oh! damn your jargon. What have you come here for? What do you want?”
 He stopped opposite to her in his restless walking. There shot a gleam
 of avarice into her dull eye.
 
 “Is he your mouthpiece?” she asked Margaret, who nodded her assent. “I
 want nothing for myself.”
 
 “For whom, then?”
 
 “The labourer is worthy of his hire.... Our Church....”
 
 “You call it a church, do you? And you are short of cash. There are not
 enough silly women, half-witted men. You want money....”
 
 “For the promulgation of our tenets.” She interrupted. “Yes, we need
 money for that, for the regeneration of the world.”
 
 “And to keep your own house going.”
 
 “Your insults do not touch me. I am uplifted from them. Nothing touches
 the true believer.”
 
 Margaret called him over to her and whispered:
 
 “Find out whether James knows anything of this or whether she is acting
 on her own; what she really wants. I can’t talk to her.”
 
 Mrs. Roope went on talking and spluttering out texts.
 
 “Cannot you see that Mrs. Capel is ill?” he said angrily.
 
 The Christian Healer was quick to take the opening he gave her.
 
 “Sickness is a growth of error, springing from man’s ignorance of
 Christian Science.”
 
 “Oh! more rot—rot—rot, _rot_! Shut it! What we want to know is if there
 is any one in this but yourself. We don’t admit a word of truth in your
 allegations. They are lies, and we have no doubt you know they are
 lies.”
 
 “Mrs. Capel will make her own deductions. What have you to do with it,
 young man?”
 
 “I’ll tell you what I have to do with it. I am here to protect this
 lady.”
 
 “Mr. Capel and his lawyer will understand.”
 
 “That isn’t what you came down here to say.”
 
 “I knew that I should be guided. I prayed about it with my husband.”
 
 “A pretty sight! ‘The Blackmailers’ Prayer!’ How it must have stank to
 Heaven! And this fellow here?”
 
 “My nephew. An honourable young man, one of the believers.”
 
 “He would be. What’s the proverb? _Bon sang ne peut pas mentir._ Well,
 for the whole lot of you, your prayerful husband, your honourable
 nephew, and yourself?”
 
 “What is it you are asking me?”
 
 “As you are here and not with James Capel it is fair to presume you’ve
 got your price. Mrs. Capel does not wish to argue or defend herself, she
 wants to be left alone. You don’t know anything because there is nothing
 to know. But I daresay you could make mischief. What are you asking to
 keep your venomous mouth shut? There is no good beating about the bush
 or talking Christian Science. Come to the point. How much?”
 
 “A thousand pounds!” They were both startled, but Peter spoke first.
 
 “That be damned for a tale.” A most unedifying dialogue ensued. Then
 Peter said, after a short whispered colloquy with Margaret:
 
 “She will give you a hundred pounds, no more and no less. Come, close,
 or leave it alone. A hundred pounds! Take it or leave it.”
 
 Margaret would have interrupted. “I said double,” she whispered. He
 translated it quickly:
 
 “Not a farthing more, she says. She has made up her mind. Either that or
 clear out and do your damnedest.”
 
 Sarah Roope stood out for her price until she nearly exhausted his
 patience, would have exhausted it but that Margaret, terrified, kept
 urging and soothing him. Before the end Mrs. Roope said a word that
 justified him—and he put his two hands on her shoulders. He made no
 point now of her being a woman. There are times when a man’s brutality
 stands him in good stead, and this was one of such occasions.
 
 “Get out of that chair,” he jerked it away from her. “Out of her
 presence. You’ll deal with me, or not at all.”
 
 He slid his hands from her shoulders to under her elbows: the noises she
 made in her throat were indescribable, but her actual resistance was
 small.
 
 “You are not to sit down in her presence.”
 
 “I prefer to stand.”
 
 “Nor stand either. Outside....” he bundled her towards the door, she
 tried to hold her ground, but he forced her along. “We’ve had nearly
 enough of you, very nearly enough. You wait outside that door. I’ll have
 a word with Mrs. Capel and give you your last chance.” She bup—ped out
 her remonstrance.
 
 “I came here to do her a service. As Mrs. Eddy writes: ‘Light and
 darkness cannot mingle.’ I must do as I am guided, and I said from the
 first we should go to James Capel. Husband and wife should never
 separate if there is no Christian demand for it.”
 
 “Oh! go to hell!”
 
 He shut the door in her face and came back to Margaret.
 
 “You’d better let me get rid of her for you. I shouldn’t pay her a brass
 farthing.”
 
 “I’d pay her anything, anything, rather than go through again what I
 went through before.” She burst into tears.
 
 “Oh! if that’s the case ...” he said indecisively.
 
 “Pay her what she wants.”
 
 “I can get her down a good bit.” He had no definite idea but to stop her
 tears, carry out her wishes. In a measure he acted cleverly, going
 backward and forward between dining and drawing-room negotiating terms.
 Mrs. Roope said she had no wish to expose Mrs. Capel, and repeated, “I
 came here to do her a kindness.”
 
 In the end two hundred and fifty pounds was agreed upon, a hundred down
 and a hundred and fifty when the decree was made absolute, this latter
 represented by a post-dated cheque. Peter had to write the cheques
 himself, it was as much as Margaret could do to sign them. Her hands
 were shaking and her eyelids red, the sight swept away all his
 conventions.
 
 “You’ve got to go to bed and stay there,” he told her when he came back
 to her finally. He forgot everything but that she looked terribly ill
 and exhausted, and that he was her physician. “You need not have a
 minute’s more anxiety. I know the type. She has gone. She won’t bother
 you again. She’s taken her hundred pounds. That’s a lot to the woman who
 makes her money by shillings. That absent treatment business is a pound
 a week at the outside. There’s a limited number of fools who pay for
 isolated visits. Did you see her boots? They didn’t look like affluence!
 and her cotton gloves! She will have another hundred and fifty if
 nothing comes out, if she keeps her mouth shut until the 30th of May.
 You are quite safe. Don’t look so woebegone. I ... I can’t bear it.”
 
 He turned his back to her.
 
 “What will Gabriel say?”
 
 “The most priggish thing he can think of,” he answered roughly.
 
 “He doesn’t look at things in the same way you do.”
 
 “Do you think I don’t know his superiority?”
 
 “Now you are angry, offended.”
 
 “You’ve done the right thing. You are not in the health for any big
 annoyance.”
 
 She was holding her side with both hands.
 
 “I believe the pain is coming on again.”
 
 “Oh; no, it isn’t.” But he moved nearer to her. No contradiction or
 denial warded off the attack. She bore it badly too, pulse and colour
 evidencing her collapse. Hurriedly and perhaps without sufficient
 thought he rang for Stevens, called for hot water, gave her her first
 injection of morphia.
 
 Stevens knew or guessed what had been going on, and took a gloomy view.
 Every one in the house knew of Mrs. Roope’s visit.
 
 “It will be the death of her.”
 
 “No, it won’t,” he said savagely. “You do what you are told.”
 
 “I ’ope I know my duty,” she replied primly.
 
 “I’m sure you do, but not the effect of a morphia injection,” he
 retorted.
 
 He said Stevens knew nothing of the effect of a morphia injection, but
 he was not quite sure of it himself in those days and with such a
 patient. The immediate effect was instantaneous. Margaret grew easier,
 she smiled at him with her pale lips:
 
 “How wonderful,” she said. He made her stay as she was for half an hour,
 then helped to carry her to bed. Stevens said she required no help in
 undressing her.
 
 “You are not to let her do a thing for herself, not to let her move.
 Give her iced milk, or milk and soda....”
 
 The afternoon was not so satisfactory, there were disquieting symptoms,
 and not the sleep for which he hoped. He suggested Dr. Lansdowne, but
 she would not hear of him being sent for. When night fell he found it
 impossible to leave her.
 
 He walked up and down outside the house for a long time, only desisting
 when Margaret herself sent down a message that she heard his footsteps
 on the gravel and they disturbed her. The rest of the night he spent on
 the drawing-room sofa, running upstairs to listen outside her bedroom
 door, now and then, to reassure himself. Tomorrow he knew Gabriel would
 be there and he would not be needed. But tonight she had no one but
 himself. Wild thoughts came to him in the dawn. What if Gabriel Stanton
 were not such a good fellow after all? What if he were put off by the
 thought of a scandal and figuring as a co-respondent? He, Peter, would
 stick to her through thick and thin. She might turn to him, get to care.
 
 But he had not an ounce of real hope. He was as humble as Gabriel by
 now, and the nearer to being a true lover.
 
 
 
 
                               CHAPTER XIII
 
 
 Margaret was not a very good subject for morphia. True it relieved her
 pain, set her mind at rest, or deadened her nerve centres for the time.
 But when the immediate effect wore off she was intolerably restless, and
 although the bromide tided her over the night, she drowsed through an
",Twilight
42," The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which
 they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed
 human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,
 however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the
 flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been
 reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and
 iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our
 unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin
 were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,
 which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have
 been already referred to.
 
 How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the
 spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a
 mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain
 tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom
 had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the
 whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold
 or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear
 the unconscious man out of the way of danger.
 
 “Well,” said our engineer ruefully, as we took our seats to return once
 more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my
 thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”
 
 “Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value,
 you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of
 being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”
 
 
 
 
 Adventure X
 
 THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
 
 
 The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long
 ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which
 the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it,
 and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this
 four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the
 full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my
 friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter
 up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little
 sketch of this remarkable episode.
 
 It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was
 still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from
 an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.
 I had remained in-doors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden
 turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I
 had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign,
 throbbed with dull persistency. With my body in one easy-chair and my
 legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers,
 until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all
 aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
 envelope upon the table, and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble
 correspondent could be.
 
 “Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked, as he entered. “Your
 morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a
 tide-waiter.”
 
 “Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he
 answered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.
 This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon
 a man either to be bored or to lie.”
 
 He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
 
 “Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest after all.”
 
 “Not social, then?”
 
 “No, distinctly professional.”
 
 “And from a noble client?”
 
 “One of the highest in England.”
 
 “My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”
 
 “I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
 client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.
 It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this
 new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,
 have you not?”
 
 “It looks like it,” said I, ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the
 corner. “I have had nothing else to do.”
 
 “It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read
 nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is
 always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely
 you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”
 
 “Oh yes, with the deepest interest.”
 
 “That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.
 Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these
 papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he
 says:
 
   “‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I
   may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion.
   I have determined, therefore, to call upon you, and to consult
   you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred
   in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,
   is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees
   no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that
   it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in
   the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at
   that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is
   of paramount importance.    Yours faithfully,   ST. SIMON.’
 
 “It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the
 noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer
 side of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes, as he folded up the
 epistle.
 
 “He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”
 
 “Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the
 subject. Turn over those papers, and arrange the extracts in their
 order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He
 picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside
 the mantel-piece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it
 out upon his knee. “Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second
 son of the Duke of Balmoral—Hum! Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief
 over a fess sable. Born in 1846. He’s forty-one years of age, which
 is mature for marriage. Was Undersecretary for the Colonies in a late
 Administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for
 Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and
 Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive
 in all this. I think that I must turn to you, Watson, for something
 more solid.”
 
 “I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for
 the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I
 feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry
 on hand, and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”
 
 “Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture
 van. That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from
 the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”
 
 “Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
 column of _The Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back.
 ‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumor is
 correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second
 son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of
 Aloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”
 
 “Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin
 legs towards the fire.
 
 “There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers
 of the same week. Ah, here it is. ‘There will soon be a call for
 protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle
 appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the
 management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the
 hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important
 addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes
 which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,
 who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little
 god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage
 with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California
 millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face
 attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an
 only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
 considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.
 As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled
 to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon
 has no property of his own, save the small estate of Birchmoor, it
 is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an
 alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition
 from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”
 
 “Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.
 
 “Oh yes; plenty. Then there is another note in _The Morning Post_ to
 say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would
 be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate
 friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the
 furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius
 Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt
 announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honey-moon
 would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are
 all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”
 
 “Before the what?” asked Holmes, with a start.
 
 “The vanishing of the lady.”
 
 “When did she vanish, then?”
 
 “At the wedding breakfast.”
 
 “Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
 dramatic, in fact.”
 
 “Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”
 
 “They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the
 honey-moon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.
 Pray let me have the details.”
 
 “I warn you that they are very incomplete.”
 
 “Perhaps we may make them less so.”
 
 “Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning
 paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular
 Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:
 
 “‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the
 greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have
 taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly
 announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;
 but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange
 rumors which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of
 the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public
 attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served
 by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.
 
 “‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,
 was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the
 bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,
 Lord Eustace, and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister
 of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party
 proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster
 Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little
 trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained,
 who endeavored to force her way into the house after the bridal party,
 alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after
 a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and
 the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before
 this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,
 when she complained of a sudden indisposition, and retired to her room.
 Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed
 her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber
 for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to
 the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave
 the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his
 mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that
 his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
 the bridegroom, instantly put themselves into communication with
 the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will
 probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.
 Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to
 the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumors of foul play in
 the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of
 the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that,
 from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the
 strange disappearance of the bride.’”
 
 “And is that all?”
 
 “Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a
 suggestive one.”
 
 “And it is—”
 
 “That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has
 actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_
 at the ‘Allegro,’ and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.
 There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands
 now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”
 
 “And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have
 missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as
 the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this
 will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I
 very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”
 
 “Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the
 door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed
 and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and
 with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had
 ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet
 his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a
 slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His
 hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled
 round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful
 to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white
 waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-colored
 gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left
 to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden
 eye-glasses.
 
 “Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take
 the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up
 a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”
 
 “A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.
 Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have
 already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I
 presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”
 
 “No, I am descending.”
 
 “I beg pardon.”
 
 “My last client of the sort was a king.”
 
 “Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”
 
 “The King of Scandinavia.”
 
 “What! Had he lost his wife?”
 
 “You can understand,” said Holmes, suavely, “that I extend to the
 affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in
 yours.”
 
 “Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own
 case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in
 forming an opinion.”
 
 “Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,
 nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article,
 for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”
 
 Lord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”
 
 “But it needs a great deal of supplementing before any one could offer
 an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by
 questioning you.”
 
 “Pray do so.”
 
 “When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”
 
 “In San Francisco, a year ago.”
 
 “You were travelling in the States?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Did you become engaged then?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “But you were on a friendly footing?”
 
 “I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”
 
 “Her father is very rich?”
 
 “He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”
 
 “And how did he make his money?”
 
 “In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
 invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”
 
 “Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s
 character?”
 
 The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the
 fire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her
 father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining
 camp, and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education
 has come from Nature rather than from the school-master. She is what
 we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free,
 unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I
 was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind, and fearless
 in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have
 given her the name which I have the honor to bear”—he gave a little
 stately cough—“had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I
 believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice, and that anything
 dishonorable would be repugnant to her.”
 
 “Have you her photograph?”
 
 “I brought this with me.” He opened a locket, and showed us the full
 face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph, but an ivory
 miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the
 lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.
 Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and
 handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
 
 “The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
 acquaintance?”
 
 “Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met
 her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”
 
 “She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”
 
 “A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”
 
 “And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait
 accompli_?”
 
 “I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”
 
 “Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
 wedding?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Was she in good spirits?”
 
 “Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future
 lives.”
 
 “Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”
 
 “She was as bright as possible—at least, until after the ceremony.”
 
 “And did you observe any change in her then?”
 
 “Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever
 seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident, however,
 was too trivial to relate, and can have no possible bearing upon the
 case.”
 
 “Pray let us have it, for all that.”
 
 “Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the
 vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over
 into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the
 pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse
 for the fall. Yet, when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me
 abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly
 agitated over this trifling cause.”
 
 “Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the
 general public were present, then?”
 
 “Oh yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”
 
 “This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”
 
 “No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
 common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I
 think that we are wandering rather far from the point.”
 
 “Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful
 frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering
 her father’s house?”
 
 “I saw her in conversation with her maid.”
 
 “And who is her maid?”
 
 “Alice is her name. She is an American, and came from California with
 her.”
 
 “A confidential servant?”
 
 “A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to
 take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these
 things in a different way.”
 
 “How long did she speak to this Alice?”
 
 “Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”
 
 “You did not overhear what they said?”
 
 “Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was
 accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”
 
 “American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do
 when she finished speaking to her maid?”
 
 “She walked into the breakfast-room.”
 
 “On your arm?”
 
 “No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.
 Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,
 muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”
 
 “But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her
 room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,
 and went out.”
 
 “Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
 company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had
 already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”
 
 “Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and
 your relations to her.”
 
 Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We
 have been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a _very_
 friendly footing. She used to be at the ‘Allegro.’ I have not treated
 her ungenerously, and she has no just cause of complaint against me;
 but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing,
 but exceedingly hot-headed, and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me
 dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married; and, to
 tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly
 was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came
 to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavored to push
 her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even
 threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the
 sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon
 pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good
 in making a row.”
 
 “Did your wife hear all this?”
 
 “No, thank goodness, she did not.”
 
 “And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”
 
 “Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so
 serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out, and laid some
 terrible trap for her.”
 
 “Well, it is a possible supposition.”
 
 “You think so, too?”
 
 “I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this
 as likely?”
 
 “I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”
 
 “Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is
 your own theory as to what took place?”
 
 “Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have
 given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it
 has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the
 consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the
 effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”
 
 “In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”
 
 “Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will
 not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without
 success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”
 
 “Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes,
 smiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my
 data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that
 you could see out of the window?”
 
 “We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”
 
 “Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I
 shall communicate with you.”
 
 “Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our
 client, rising.
 
 “I have solved it.”
 
 “Eh? What was that?”
 
 “I say that I have solved it.”
 
 “Where, then, is my wife?”
 
 “That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”
 
 Lord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser
 heads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,
 old-fashioned manner, he departed.
 
 “It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honor my head by putting it
 on a level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think
 that I shall have a whiskey-and-soda and a cigar after all this
 cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before
 our client came into the room.”
 
 “My dear Holmes!”
 
 “I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked
 before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to
 turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is
 occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to
 quote Thoreau’s example.”
 
 “But I have heard all that you have heard.”
 
 “Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me
 so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back,
 and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the
 Franco-Prussian war. It is one of these cases—but, hello, here is
 Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon
 the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”
 
 The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which
 gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas
 bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the
 cigar which had been offered to him.
 
 “What’s up, then?” asked Holmes, with a twinkle in his eye. “You look
 dissatisfied.”
 
 “And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.
 I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”
 
 “Really! You surprise me.”
 
 “Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clew seems to slip
 through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”
 
 “And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes, laying his hand
 upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
 
 “Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”
 
 “In Heaven’s name, what for?”
 
 “In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
 
 “Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.
 
 “Why? What do you mean?”
 
 “Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one
 as in the other.”
 
 Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all
 about it,” he snarled.
",Holmes
43," steadily at him.
 
 “Quite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?”
 
 “Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don’t
 know how long and all,” replied the girl carelessly. “Come! Let me get
 back; that’s a dear.”
 
 With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her
 hand. They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a
 “good-night.”
 
 When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep;
 and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue
 her way. Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite
 opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened
 her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run. After
 completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if
 suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do
 something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.
 
 It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full
 hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with
 nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover
 lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own
 thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the
 housebreaker.
 
 If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes,
 he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the
 money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of
 satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the
 slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.
 
 It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so
 much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal
 had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his
 temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical
 upon her behaviour and deportment. That she had all the abstracted and
 nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous
 step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would
 have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have
 taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of
 discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than
 those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour
 towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable
 condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her
 demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had
 her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been
 very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.
 
 As that day closed in, the girl’s excitement increased; and, when night
 came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink
 himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire
 in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.
 
 Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water
 with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass
 towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when
 these symptoms first struck him.
 
 “Why, burn my body!” said the man, raising himself on his hands as he
 stared the girl in the face. “You look like a corpse come to life
 again. What’s the matter?”
 
 “Matter!” replied the girl. “Nothing. What do you look at me so hard
 for?”
 
 “What foolery is this?” demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and
 shaking her roughly. “What is it? What do you mean? What are you
 thinking of?”
 
 “Of many things, Bill,” replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so,
 pressing her hands upon her eyes. “But, Lord! What odds in that?”
 
 The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed
 to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look
 which had preceded them.
 
 “I tell you wot it is,” said Sikes; “if you haven’t caught the fever,
 and got it comin’ on, now, there’s something more than usual in the
 wind, and something dangerous too. You’re not a-going to—. No, damme!
 you wouldn’t do that!”
 
 “Do what?” asked the girl.
 
 “There ain’t,” said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the
 words to himself; “there ain’t a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I’d
 have cut her throat three months ago. She’s got the fever coming on;
 that’s it.”
 
 Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the
 bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The
 girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with
 her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank
 off the contents.
 
 “Now,” said the robber, “come and sit aside of me, and put on your own
 face; or I’ll alter it so, that you won’t know it agin when you do want
 it.”
 
 The girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the
 pillow: turning his eyes upon her face. They closed; opened again;
 closed once more; again opened. He shifted his position restlessly;
 and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as
 often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about
 him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of
 rising, into a deep and heavy sleep. The grasp of his hand relaxed; the
 upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a
 profound trance.
 
 “The laudanum has taken effect at last,” murmured the girl, as she rose
 from the bedside. “I may be too late, even now.”
 
 She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully
 round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she
 expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes’s heavy hand upon
 her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the
 robber’s lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with
 noiseless touch, hurried from the house.
 
 A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which
 she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.
 
 “Has it long gone the half-hour?” asked the girl.
 
 “It’ll strike the hour in another quarter,” said the man: raising his
 lantern to her face.
 
 “And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,” muttered Nancy:
 brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.
 
 Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues
 through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards
 the West-End of London. The clock struck ten, increasing her
 impatience. She tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers
 from side to side; and darting almost under the horses’ heads, crossed
 crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their
 opportunity to do the like.
 
 “The woman is mad!” said the people, turning to look after her as she
 rushed away.
 
 When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were
 comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still
 greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. Some
 quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening
 at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back,
 surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and
 when she neared her place of destination, she was alone.
 
 It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. As
 the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her
 to the spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces
 as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound
 determined her, and she stepped into the hall. The porter’s seat was
 vacant. She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced
 towards the stairs.
 
 “Now, young woman!” said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a
 door behind her, “who do you want here?”
 
 “A lady who is stopping in this house,” answered the girl.
 
 “A lady!” was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. “What lady?”
 
 “Miss Maylie,” said Nancy.
 
 The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied
 only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her.
 To him, Nancy repeated her request.
 
 “What name am I to say?” asked the waiter.
 
 “It’s of no use saying any,” replied Nancy.
 
 “Nor business?” said the man.
 
 “No, nor that neither,” rejoined the girl. “I must see the lady.”
 
 “Come!” said the man, pushing her towards the door. “None of this. Take
 yourself off.”
 
 “I shall be carried out if I go!” said the girl violently; “and I can
 make that a job that two of you won’t like to do. Isn’t there anybody
 here,” she said, looking round, “that will see a simple message carried
 for a poor wretch like me?”
 
 This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who
 with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward
 to interfere.
 
 “Take it up for her, Joe; can’t you?” said this person.
 
 “What’s the good?” replied the man. “You don’t suppose the young lady
 will see such as her; do you?”
 
 This allusion to Nancy’s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of
 chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great
 fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly
 advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.
 
 “Do what you like with me,” said the girl, turning to the men again;
 “but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for
 God Almighty’s sake.”
 
 The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that
 the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.
 
 “What’s it to be?” said the man, with one foot on the stairs.
 
 “That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,” said
 Nancy; “and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to
 say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned
 out of doors as an impostor.”
 
 “I say,” said the man, “you’re coming it strong!”
 
 “You give the message,” said the girl firmly; “and let me hear the
 answer.”
 
 The man ran upstairs. Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless,
 listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn,
 of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they
 became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman
 was to walk upstairs.
 
 “It’s no good being proper in this world,” said the first housemaid.
 
 “Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,” said the
 second.
 
 The third contented herself with wondering “what ladies was made of”;
 and the fourth took the first in a quartette of “Shameful!” with which
 the Dianas concluded.
 
 Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy
 followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber,
 lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XL.
 A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER
 
 
 The girl’s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most
 noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the
 woman’s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light
 step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered,
 and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another
 moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame,
 and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with
 whom she had sought this interview.
 
 But struggling with these better feelings was pride,—the vice of the
 lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and
 self-assured. The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the
 fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the
 jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,—even
 this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the
 womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected
 her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so
 many, many traces when a very child.
 
 She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which
 presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending
 them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as
 she said:
 
 “It’s a hard matter to get to see you, lady. If I had taken offence,
 and gone away, as many would have done, you’d have been sorry for it
 one day, and not without reason either.”
 
 “I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,” replied Rose.
 “Do not think of that. Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the
 person you inquired for.”
 
 The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the
 absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl
 completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.
 
 “Oh, lady, lady!” she said, clasping her hands passionately before her
 face, “if there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,—there
 would—there would!”
 
 “Sit down,” said Rose, earnestly. “If you are in poverty or affliction
 I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,—I shall indeed. Sit
 down.”
 
 “Let me stand, lady,” said the girl, still weeping, “and do not speak
 to me so kindly till you know me better. It is growing late. Is—is—that
 door shut?”
 
 “Yes,” said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance
 in case she should require it. “Why?”
 
 “Because,” said the girl, “I am about to put my life and the lives of
 others in your hands. I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to
 old Fagin’s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.”
 
 “You!” said Rose Maylie.
 
 “I, lady!” replied the girl. “I am the infamous creature you have heard
 of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment
 I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known
 any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me
 God! Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you
 would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women
 fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.”
 
 “What dreadful things are these!” said Rose, involuntarily falling from
 her strange companion.
 
 “Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,” cried the girl, “that you
 had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you
 were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness,
 and—and—something worse than all—as I have been from my cradle. I may
 use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be
 my deathbed.”
 
 “I pity you!” said Rose, in a broken voice. “It wrings my heart to hear
 you!”
 
 “Heaven bless you for your goodness!” rejoined the girl. “If you knew
 what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away
 from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to
 tell you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?”
 
 “No,” said Rose.
 
 “He knows you,” replied the girl; “and knew you were here, for it was
 by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.”
 
 “I never heard the name,” said Rose.
 
 “Then he goes by some other amongst us,” rejoined the girl, “which I
 more than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put
 into your house on the night of the robbery, I—suspecting this
 man—listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.
 I found out, from what I heard, that Monks—the man I asked you about,
 you know—”
 
 “Yes,” said Rose, “I understand.”
 
 “—That Monks,” pursued the girl, “had seen him accidently with two of
 our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be
 the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn’t make out
 why. A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he
 should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a
 thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.”
 
 “For what purpose?” asked Rose.
 
 “He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of
 finding out,” said the girl; “and there are not many people besides me
 that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery. But I
 did; and I saw him no more till last night.”
 
 “And what occurred then?”
 
 “I’ll tell you, lady. Last night he came again. Again they went
 upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray
 me, again listened at the door. The first words I heard Monks say were
 these: ‘So the only proofs of the boy’s identity lie at the bottom of
 the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is
 rotting in her coffin.’ They laughed, and talked of his success in
 doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,
 said that though he had got the young devil’s money safely now, he’d
 rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been
 to have brought down the boast of the father’s will, by driving him
 through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital
 felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit
 of him besides.”
 
 “What is all this!” said Rose.
 
 “The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,” replied the girl.
 “Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to
 yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy’s life
 without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn’t,
 he’d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he
 took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. ‘In
 short, Fagin,’ he says, ‘Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as
 I’ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.’”
 
 “His brother!” exclaimed Rose.
 
 “Those were his words,” said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had
 scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes
 haunted her perpetually. “And more. When he spoke of you and the other
 lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against
 him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said
 there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds
 of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who
 your two-legged spaniel was.”
 
 “You do not mean,” said Rose, turning very pale, “to tell me that this
 was said in earnest?”
 
 “He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,” replied the
 girl, shaking her head. “He is an earnest man when his hatred is up. I
 know many who do worse things; but I’d rather listen to them all a
 dozen times, than to that Monks once. It is growing late, and I have to
 reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this.
 I must get back quickly.”
 
 “But what can I do?” said Rose. “To what use can I turn this
 communication without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to
 companions you paint in such terrible colors? If you repeat this
 information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the
 next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an
 hour’s delay.”
 
 “I wish to go back,” said the girl. “I must go back, because—how can I
 tell such things to an innocent lady like you?—because among the men I
 have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that
 I can’t leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading
 now.”
 
 “Your having interfered in this dear boy’s behalf before,” said Rose;
 “your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard;
 your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your
 evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you
 might yet be reclaimed. Oh!” said the earnest girl, folding her hands
 as the tears coursed down her face, “do not turn a deaf ear to the
 entreaties of one of your own sex; the first—the first, I do believe,
 who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion. Do hear
 my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.”
 
 “Lady,” cried the girl, sinking on her knees, “dear, sweet, angel lady,
 you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and
 if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of
 sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!”
 
 “It is never too late,” said Rose, “for penitence and atonement.”
 
 “It is,” cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; “I cannot leave
 him now! I could not be his death.”
 
 “Why should you be?” asked Rose.
 
 “Nothing could save him,” cried the girl. “If I told others what I have
 told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is
 the boldest, and has been so cruel!”
 
 “Is it possible,” cried Rose, “that for such a man as this, you can
 resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is
 madness.”
 
 “I don’t know what it is,” answered the girl; “I only know that it is
 so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and
 wretched as myself. I must go back. Whether it is God’s wrath for the
 wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through
 every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew
 that I was to die by his hand at last.”
 
 “What am I to do?” said Rose. “I should not let you depart from me
 thus.”
 
 “You should, lady, and I know you will,” rejoined the girl, rising.
 “You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness,
 and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.”
 
 “Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?” said Rose.
 “This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me,
 benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?”
 
 “You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a
 secret, and advise you what to do,” rejoined the girl.
 
 “But where can I find you again when it is necessary?” asked Rose. “I
 do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will
 you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?”
 
 “Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and
 come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I
 shall not be watched or followed?” asked the girl.
 
 “I promise you solemnly,” answered Rose.
 
 “Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,” said
 the girl without hesitation, “I will walk on London Bridge if I am
 alive.”
 
 “Stay another moment,” interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly
 towards the door. “Think once again on your own condition, and the
 opportunity you have of escaping from it. You have a claim on me: not
 only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost
 almost beyond redemption. Will you return to this gang of robbers, and
 to this man, when a word can save you? What fascination is it that can
 take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is
 there no chord in your heart that I can touch! Is there nothing left,
 to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!”
 
 “When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,” replied the
 girl steadily, “give away your hearts, love will carry you all
 lengths—even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers,
 everything, to fill them. When such as I, who have no certain roof but
 the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital
 nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place
 that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to
 cure us? Pity us, lady—pity us for having only one feeling of the woman
 left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort
 and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.”
 
 “You will,” said Rose, after a pause, “take some money from me, which
 may enable you to live without dishonesty—at all events until we meet
 again?”
 
 “Not a penny,” replied the girl, waving her hand.
 
 “Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,” said
 Rose, stepping gently forward. “I wish to serve you indeed.”
 
 “You would serve me best, lady,” replied the girl, wringing her hands,
 “if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think
 of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be
 something not to die in the hell in which I have lived. God bless you,
 sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought
 shame on mine!”
 
 Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away;
 while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which
 had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank
 into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLI.
 CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE
 MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE
 
 
 Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While
 she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in
 which Oliver’s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the
 confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed,
 had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner
 had touched Rose Maylie’s heart; and, mingled with her love for her
 young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was
 her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.
 
 They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing
 for some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of
 the first day. What course of action could she determine upon, which
 could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone
 the journey without exciting suspicion?
 
 Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but
 Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman’s
 impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first
 explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of
 Oliver’s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her
 representations in the girl’s behalf could be seconded by no
 experienced person. These were all reasons for the greatest caution and
 most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose
 first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy
 doctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if
 she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the
 same reason. Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance
 from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting,
 and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when—the tears rose to
 her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection—he might have by this
 time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.
 
 Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course
 and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive
 consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and
 anxious night. After more communing with herself next day, she arrived
 at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.
 
 “If it be painful to him,” she thought, “to come back here, how painful
 it will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may
 come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me—he did when he
 went away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.”
 And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very
 paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.
 
 She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and
 had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without
 writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the
 streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such
 breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new
 cause of alarm.
 
 “What makes you look so flurried?” asked Rose, advancing to meet him.
 
 “I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,” replied the boy.
 “Oh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be
 able to know that I have told you the truth!”
 
 “I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,” said Rose,
 soothing him. “But what is this?—of whom do you speak?”
 
 “I have seen the gentleman,” replied Oliver, scarcely able to
 articulate, “the gentleman who was so good to me—Mr. Brownlow, that we
 have so often talked about.”
 
 “Where?” asked Rose.
 
 “Getting out of a coach,” replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight,
 “and going into a house. I didn’t speak to him—I couldn’t speak to him,
 for he didn’t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up
 to him. But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said
 he did. Look here,” said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, “here it is;
 here’s where he lives—I’m going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me!
 What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!”
 
 With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many
 other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was
 Craven Street, in the Strand. She very soon determined upon turning the
 discovery to account.
 
 “Quick!” she said. “Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to
 go with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute’s loss of
 time. I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and
 be ready as soon as you are.”
 
 Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five
 minutes they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived
 there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the
 old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,
 requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. The servant
 soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him
 into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman
 of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. At no great distance
 from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and
 gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting
 with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin
 propped thereupon.
 
 “Dear me,” said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising
 with great politeness, “I beg your pardon, young lady—I imagined it was
 some importunate person who—I beg you will excuse me. Be seated, pray.”
 
 “Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?” said Rose, glancing from the other
 gentleman to the one who had spoken.
 
 “That is my name,” said the old gentleman. “This is my friend, Mr.
 Grimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?”
 
 “I believe,” interposed Miss Maylie, “that at this period of our
 interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If
 I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I
 wish to speak to you.”
 
 Mr. Brownlow inclined his head. Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very
 stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and
 dropped into it again.
 
 “I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,” said Rose, naturally
 embarrassed; “but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a
 very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest
 in hearing of him again.”
 
 “Indeed!” said Mr. Brownlow.
 
 “Oliver Twist you knew him as,” replied Rose.
 
 The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been
 affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with
 a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his
 features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged
 in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed
 so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into
 his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long
 deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air,
 but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.
 
 Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not
 expressed in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to
 Miss Maylie’s, and said,
 
 “Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the
 question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which
 nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce
 any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once
 induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven’s name put me in
 possession of it.”
 
 “A bad one! I’ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,” growled Mr.
 Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle
 of his face.
 
 “He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,” said Rose,
 colouring; “and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his
 years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do
 honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.”
 
 “I’m only sixty-one,” said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. “And,
 as the devil’s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I
 don’t see the application of that remark.”
 
 “Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,” said Mr. Brownlow; “he does not
 mean what he says.”
 
 “Yes, he does,” growled Mr. Grimwig.
 
 “No, he does not,” said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he
 spoke.
 
 “He’ll eat his head, if he doesn’t,” growled Mr. Grimwig.
 
 “He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,” said Mr.
 Brownlow.
 
 “And he’d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,” responded Mr.
 Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.
 
 Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and
 afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.
 
 “Now, Miss Maylie,” said Mr. Brownlow, “to return to the subject in
 which your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what
 intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I
 exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I
 have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had
 imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob
 me, has been considerably shaken.”
 
 Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a
 few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.
 Brownlow’s house; reserving Nancy’s information for that gentleman’s
 private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,
 for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former
 benefactor and friend.
 
 “Thank God!” said the old gentleman. “This is great happiness to me,
 great happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie.
 You must pardon my finding fault with you,—but why not have brought
 him?”
 
 “He is waiting in a coach at the door,” replied Rose.
 
 “At this door!” cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out of
 the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach,
 without another word.
 
 When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head,
 and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot,
 described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and
 the table; sitting in it all the time. After performing this evolution,
 he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a
 dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without
 the slightest preface.
 
 “Hush!” he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual
 proceeding. “Don’t be afraid. I’m old enough to be your grandfather.
 You’re a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!”
 
 In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former
 seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig
 received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had
 been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver’s behalf,
 Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.
 
 “There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,” said
 Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. “Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.”
 
 The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and
 dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.
 
 “Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,” said Mr. Brownlow, rather
 testily.
 
 “Well, that I do, sir,” replied the old lady. “People’s eyes, at my
 time of life, don’t improve with age, sir.”
 
 “I could have told you that,” rejoined Mr. Brownlow; “but put on your
 glasses, and see if you can’t find out what you were wanted for, will
 you?”
 
 The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But
 Oliver’s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to
 his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.
 
 “God be good to me!” cried the old lady, embracing him; “it is my
 innocent boy!”
 
 “My dear old nurse!” cried Oliver.
 
 “He would come back—I knew he would,” said the old lady, holding him in
 her arms. “How well he looks, and how like a gentleman’s son he is
 dressed again! Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same
 sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad. I have
 never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day,
 side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I
 was a lightsome young creature.” Running on thus, and now holding
 Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and
 passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and
 wept upon his neck by turns.
 
 Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led
 the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration
 of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise
 and perplexity. Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in
 her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman
 considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold
 solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. To afford him an
 early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged
 that he should call at the hotel at eight o’clock that evening, and
 that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all
 that had occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver
 returned home.
 
 Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor’s wrath.
 Nancy’s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a
 shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the
 first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff;
 and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the
 assistance of those worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first
 outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment’s
 consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in
 part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was
 himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and
 representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his
 hotbrained purpose.
 
 “Then what the devil is to be done?” said the impetuous doctor, when
 they had rejoined the two ladies. “Are we to pass a vote of thanks to
 all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred
 pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some
 slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?”
 
 “Not exactly that,” rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; “but we must
 proceed gently and with great care.”
 
 “Gentleness and care,” exclaimed the doctor. “I’d send them one and all
 to—”
 
 “Never mind where,” interposed Mr. Brownlow. “But reflect whether
 sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.”
 
 “What object?” asked the doctor.
 
 “Simply, the discovery of Oliver’s parentage, and regaining for him the
 inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently
 deprived.”
 
 “Ah!” said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief;
 “I almost forgot that.”
 
 “You see,” pursued Mr. Brownlow; “placing this poor girl entirely out
 of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these
 scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should
 we bring about?”
 
 “Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,” suggested the
 doctor, “and transporting the rest.”
 
 “Very good,” replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; “but no doubt they will
 bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step
 in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very
 Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest—or at least to
 Oliver’s, which is the same thing.”
 
 “How?” inquired the doctor.
 
 “Thus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in
 getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man,
 Monks, upon his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by
 catching him when he is not surrounded by these people. For, suppose he
 were apprehended, we have no proof against him. He is not even (so far
 as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in
 any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely
 that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to
 prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth
 would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes,
 be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.”
 
 “Then,” said the doctor impetuously, “I put it to you again, whether
 you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be
 considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest
 intentions, but really—”
 
 “Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,” said Mr.
 Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. “The promise
 shall be kept. I don’t think it will, in the slightest degree,
 interfere with our proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any
 precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to
 ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the
 understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law;
 or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an
 account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us
 to identify him. She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is
 Tuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly
 quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.”
 
 Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving
 a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course
 occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very
 strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman’s proposition was carried
 unanimously.
 
 “I should like,” he said, “to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. He
 is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material
 assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted
 the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of
 course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not,
 you must determine for yourselves.”
 
 “I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in
 mine,” said the doctor.
 
 “We must put it to the vote,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “who may he be?”
 
 “That lady’s son, and this young lady’s—very old friend,” said the
 doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an
 expressive glance at her niece.
 
 Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this
 motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and
 Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.
 
 “We stay in town, of course,” said Mrs. Maylie, “while there remains
 the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of
 success. I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the
 object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to
 remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that
 any hope remains.”
 
 “Good!” rejoined Mr. Brownlow. “And as I see on the faces about me, a
 disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to
 corroborate Oliver’s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me
 stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may
 deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe
 me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite
 hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and
 disappointments already quite numerous enough. Come! Supper has been
 announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will
 have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company,
 and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the
 world.”
 
 With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and
 escorted her into the supper-room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose;
 and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLII.
 AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER’S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,
 BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS
 
 
 Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on
",OliverTwist
44," things worse.
 
 “He would ever so much rather hear it from you if it must be told him,”
 he urged. “He’ll guess you are ill when you are not at the station.
 He’ll rush up here and see you and everything will be all right. He has
 only got to see you.”
 
 Dr. Kennedy then begged her to go back to bed, but without effect.
 Fortunately the only drug to which he could ultimately persuade her was
 carbonate of soda! That and a strong cup of coffee helped to revive her.
 Stevens had the qualities of her defects and insisted later upon beef
 tea. Margaret, although still looking ill, was really almost normal when
 four o’clock came bringing Gabriel. Her plan of Peter Kennedy meeting
 him miscarried, and she need not have feared his anxiety when she was
 not at the station. Gabriel had caught an earlier train than usual. Ever
 since Tuesday his anxiety had been growing, notwithstanding her letters
 and reassurances.
 
 He was dismayed at seeing Dr. Kennedy’s hat in the hall. Little more so
 than Margaret was when she heard the wheels of the car on the gravel and
 learnt from Peter, at the window, that Gabriel was in it. They were
 unprepared for each other when he walked in. Yet if Peter had not been
 there all might still have been well. It was Dr. Kennedy’s instinct to
 stand between her and trouble, and his misfortune to stand between her
 and Gabriel Stanton.
 
 “You are ill?” and
 
 “You are early?” came from each of them simultaneously. If the doctor
 had slipped out of the room they would perhaps have found more to say.
 But he stayed and joined in that short dialogue, thinking he was meeting
 her wishes.
 
 “She has had an attack of angina, a pretty hot one at that. I gave her a
 morphia injection and it did not suit her. She is simply not fit for any
 emotion or excitement. As a matter of fact she ought not to be out of
 bed today.”
 
 “Has my coming by an earlier train distressed you?” Gabriel asked
 Margaret, perhaps a little coldly. Certainly not as he would have asked
 her had they been alone. Nor were matters improved when she answered
 faintly:
 
 “Tell him, Peter.”
 
 Her lover wanted to hear nothing that Peter Kennedy might tell him. He
 was startled when she used his Christian name. He had a distaste at
 hearing his fiancée’s health discussed, a sensitiveness not unnatural.
 From an older or more impersonal physician he might have minded it less;
 or from one who had not admitted to him, and gloried in the admission,
 that he was in love with his patient.
 
 “I don’t want to hear anything that Dr. Kennedy can tell me,” was what
 he said, but it misrepresented his mind. It sounded sullen or
 ill-tempered, but was neither, only an inarticulate evidence of distress
 of mind.
 
 “Surely, Margaret, your news can wait....” This was added in a lower
 tone. But Margaret was beyond, and Peter Kennedy impervious to hint. The
 only thing that softened the situation to Gabriel was that she made room
 for him on the sofa, by a gesture inviting him to seat himself there.
 Almost he pretended not to see it, he felt rigid and uncompromising.
 Nevertheless, after a moment’s hesitation, he found himself beside her,
 listening to Dr. Kennedy’s unwelcome voice.
 
 “You knew, didn’t you, that there had been a man hanging about the
 place, trying to get information from the servants? Margaret first heard
 of this last Tuesday....” Gabriel missed the next sentence. That the
 fellow should speak of her as “Margaret” made him see red. When his
 vision cleared Peter was still talking. There had been some allusion to
 or description of cook’s weakness, and the discursiveness was a fresh
 offence.
 
 “What she told him in her amorous moments we have no means of knowing,
 but that it included the information that you had stayed in the house
 there is not much reason to doubt. And down came this woman like a ton
 of bricks on Wednesday morning and flung a bomb on us in the shape of a
 demand for a thousand pounds.”
 
 “What woman?”
 
 “The man’s employer. She had set him on to it.”
 
 “Who?”
 
 “This blackmailing person.”
 
 The “us” tightened Gabriel’s thin lips and hardened his deep-set eyes.
 Had they been alone he might have remembered what Margaret must have
 suffered, what a dreadful thing this visit must have been to her. As it
 was, and for the moment, he thought of nothing but of Peter Kennedy’s
 intervention, interference.
 
 “Why did you see her?” he asked Margaret.
 
 “I thought she came from Anne,” she faltered.
 
 “From Anne!”
 
 “She is the Christian Science woman,” Peter explained.
 
 And now indeed the full force of the blow struck him.
 
 “Mrs. Roope?” he got out.
 
 “No other,” Peter answered. “Crammed choke-full of extracts from Mrs.
 Eddy. James Capel is her husband’s cousin. At least so she says. And
 that he never wanted to be divorced from his wife, and would welcome a
 chance of stopping the decree from being made absolute. She said the
 higher morality bade her go to him. ‘Husband and wife should never
 separate if there is no Christian demand for it,’ she quoted. But help
 toward the Christian Science Church, or movement, she would construe as
 ‘a Christian demand.’ She asked for a thousand pounds! Mrs. Capel,” this
 time for some unknown reason he said “Mrs. Capel” and Gabriel heard
 better, “was quite overwhelmed, knocked to pieces by her impudence.
 That’s when I came on the scene. I told the woman what I thought of her;
 you may bet I didn’t mince matters. And then I offered her a
 hundred....”
 
 Gabriel got up suddenly, abruptly, his face flushed.
 
 “You ... you offered her a hundred pounds?”
 
 “Well! there was not a bit of good trying for less. It was a round sum.”
 
 “You allowed Mrs. Capel to be blackmailed!”
 
 “What would you have done? Of course I did.”
 
 “It was disgraceful, indefensible.”
 
 “Gabriel.” She called him by his name, she wanted him to sit down by
 her, but he remained standing. “There was no time to send for any one,
 ask for advice....”
 
 “It was a case of ‘your money or your life.’ The woman put a pistol to
 our heads. ‘Pay up or I’ll take my tale to James Capel’ was the
 beginning and end of what she said. I got her down finally to £250.”
 
 “You gave the woman, this infamous, blackmailing person, £250?”
 
 “And cheap enough too. Wait a bit. I can guess what you are thinking.
 I’m not such a fool as you take me for. She only had a hundred in cash,
 the other is a post-dated cheque, not due until the decree is made
 absolute. Then I ran her out of the house.”
 
 “Who wrote those cheques?” The flush deepened, Gabriel could hardly
 control his voice.
 
 “I wrote them and Mrs. Capel signed them. She was absolutely bowled
 over, it was as much as she could do to sign her name.”
 
 Gabriel was beside himself or he would not have spoken as he did.
 
 “You did an infamous thing, sir, an infamous thing. You should have
 guarded this lady, since I was not here, sheltered her innocence. To
 allow oneself to be blackmailed is an admission of guilt. The way you
 sheltered her innocence was to advise her practically to admit guilt.”
 He was choked with anger.
 
 “Gabriel,” she pleaded.
 
 “My dear,” never had he spoken to her in such a way, he seemed hardly to
 remember she was there, “I acquit you entirely. You did not know what
 you were doing, could not be expected to know. But _this_ fellow, this
 blackguard....” He actually advanced a step or two toward him,
 threateningly. “Her good name was at stake, mine as well as hers, was
 and is at stake.”
 
 “And I saved it for you, for both of you. I’ve shut Mrs. Roope’s mouth.
 You’ll never hear a word more....”
 
 “Not hear more?” Gabriel was deeply contemptuous. “Did you ever know a
 blackmailer who was satisfied with the first blood? You have opened the
 door wide to her exactions....”
 
 “You are taking an entirely wrong view, you are prejudiced. Because you
 don’t like me you blame me whether I am right or wrong.”
 
 “You don’t know the difference between right and wrong.”
 
 “I wasn’t going to have my patient upset,” he said obstinately.
 
 “Gabriel, listen to me, hear me. Don’t be so angry with Peter. _I_
 wanted the woman paid to keep quiet. I insisted upon her being paid.”
 And then under her breath she said, “There is such a little time more.”
 
 “There is all our lives,” Gabriel answered in that deep outraged voice.
 “All our lives it will be a stain that money was paid. As if we had
 something to conceal.”
 
 His point of view was not theirs, neither Peter’s nor Margaret’s. They
 argued and protested, justifying themselves and each other. But it
 seemed to Gabriel there was no argument. When Margaret pleaded he had to
 listen, to hold himself in hand, to say as little as possible. Toward
 Peter Kennedy he was irreconcilable. “A man _ought_ to have known,” he
 said doggedly.
 
 “He wanted to ward off an attack.”
 
 Dr. Kennedy went away ultimately, he had that amount of sense. By this
 time he was at least as antagonistic to Gabriel Stanton as Gabriel to
 him.
 
 “Stiff-necked blighter! He’d talk ethics if she were dying. What does it
 matter whether it was right or wrong? Anyway, I got rid of the woman for
 her, set her mind at rest. I bet my way was as good as any _he’d_ have
 found! Now I suppose he’ll argue her round until she looks upon me as
 the villain of the play.” In which, as the sequel shows, he wronged his
 lady love. “Insufferable prig!” And with that and a few more muttered
 epithets he went off to endure a hideous few days, fearing for her all
 the time, in the hands of such a man as Gabriel Stanton, whom he deemed
 hard and self-righteous.
 
 But he need not have feared. The two men were poles apart in
 temperament, education, and environment. Circumstances aided in making
 them intolerant of each other. Their judgment was biased. Margaret saw
 them both more clearly than they saw each other. Her lover was the
 stronger, finer man, had the higher standard. And he was right, right
 this time, as always. Yet she thought sympathetically of the other and
 the weakness that led him to compromise. The Christian Scientist should
 not have been paid, she should have been prosecuted. Margaret saw it
 now,—she, too, had not seen it at the moment. She confessed herself a
 coward.
 
 “But our happiness was at stake, our whole happiness. In less than three
 weeks now....”
 
 Now that they were alone Gabriel could show his quality. The thing she
 had done was indefensible. And he had hardly a hope that it would
 achieve its object. He, himself, would not have done evil that good
 might come of it, submitted, admitted ... the blood rushed to his face
 and he could not trust himself even to think of what had practically
 been admitted. But she had done it for love of him to secure their
 happiness together. What man but would be moved by such an admission,
 what lover? He could not hold out against her, nor continue to express
 his doubts.
 
 “Must we talk any more about it? I can’t bear your reproaches. Gabriel,
 don’t reproach me any more.” She was nestling in the shelter of his
 arms. “You know why I did it. I wish you would be glad.”
 
 “My darling, I wish I could be. It was not your fault. I ought to have
 come down. You ought not to have been left alone, or with an
 unscrupulous person like this doctor.”
 
 “Peter acted according to his lights. He did it for the best, he thought
 only of me.”
 
 “His lights are darkness, his best outrageous. Never mind, I will not
 say another word, only you must promise me faithfully, swear to me that
 if you do hear any more of this woman, or of the circumstance, from this
 or any other quarter, you will do nothing without consulting me, you
 will send for me at once....”
 
 Margaret promised, Margaret swore.
 
 “I want to lean upon your strength. I have so altered I don’t know
 myself. Love has loosened, weakened me. I am no longer as I was, proud,
 self-reliant. Gabriel, don’t let me be sorry that I love you. I am
 startled by myself, by this new self. What have you done to me? Is this
 what love means—weakness?”
 
 When she said she needed to lean upon his strength his heart ran like
 water to her. When she pleaded to him for forgiveness because she had
 allowed herself to be blackmailed rather than delay their happiness
 together, his tenderness overflowed and flooded the rock of his logic,
 of his clear judgment. His arms tightened about her.
 
 “I ought to have come to you whether you said yes or no. I knew you were
 in trouble.”
 
 “Not any longer.” She nestled to him.
 
 “God knows....”
 
 He thrust aside his misgivings later and gave himself up to soothing and
 nursing her. Peter Kennedy need have had no fear, but then of course
 this was a Gabriel Stanton he did not know.
 
 Gabriel would not hear of Margaret coming down to dinner nor into the
 drawing-room. She was to stay on the sofa in the music room, to have her
 dinner served to her there. He said he would carve for her, not be ten
 minutes away.
 
 “All this trouble has made me forget that I have something to tell you.
 No, no! Not now, not until you have rested.”
 
 “I can’t wait, I can’t wait. Tell me now, at once. But I know. I know by
 your face. It is about our little house. You have seen a house—our
 house!”
 
 “Not until after dinner. I must not tell you anything until you have
 rested, had something to eat. You have been too agitated. Dear love, you
 have been through so much. Yes, I have seen the house that seems to have
 been built for us. Don’t urge me to tell you now. This has been the
 first cloud that has come between us. It will never happen again. You
 will keep nothing from me.”
 
 “Haven’t I promised? Sworn?”
 
 “Sweetheart!” And as he held her she whispered:
 
 “You will never be angry with me again?”
 
 “I was not angry with you. How could I be?”
 
 She smiled. She was quite happy again now, and content.
 
 “It looked like anger.”
 
 “You focussed it wrongly,” he answered.
 
                   *       *       *       *       *
 
 After they had dined; she on her sofa from a tray he supervised and sent
 up to her, he in solitary state in the dining-room, hurrying through the
 food that had no flavour to him in her absence: he told her about the
 little house in Westminster that he had seen, and that seemed to fit all
 their requirements. It was very early eighteenth-century, every brick of
 it had been laid before Robert Adam and his brother went to Portland
 Place, the walls were panelled and the mantelpieces untouched. They were
 of carved wood in the drawing-room, painted alabaster in the library and
 bedrooms, marble in the dining-room only. It was almost within the
 precincts of the Abbey and there was a tiny courtyard or garden.
 Margaret immediately envisaged it tiled and Dutch. Gabriel left it stone
 and defended his opinion. There was a lead figure with the pretence of a
 fountain.
 
 “I could hardly believe my good luck when first I saw the place. I saw
 you there at once. It was just as you had described, as we had hoped
 for, unique and perfect in its way, a real home. It needs very careful
 furnishing, nothing must be large, nor handsome, nor on an elaborate
 scale. I shall find out the history, when it was built and for whom. A
 clergy house, I think.”
 
 She was full of enthusiasm and pressed for detail. Gabriel had to admit
 he did not know how it was lit, nor if electric light had been
 installed. He fancied not. Then there was the question of bathroom. Here
 too there was a lapse in his memory. But that there was space for one he
 was sure. There was a powder room off the drawing-room.
 
 “In a clergy house?”
 
 “I am not sure it was a clergy house.”
 
 “Or that there _is_ a powder room!”
 
 “It may have been meant for books. Anyway, there is one like it on the
 next floor.”
 
 “Where a bath could be put?”
 
 “Yes, I think so. I am not sure. You will have to see it yourself. Nurse
 yourself for a few days and then come up.”
 
 “For a few days! That is good. Why, I am all right now, tonight. There,
 feel my pulse.” She put her hand in his and he held it; her hand, not
 her pulse.
 
 “Isn’t it quite calm?”
 
 “I don’t know ... _I_ am not.”
 
 “I shall go up with you on Monday morning, or by the next train.”
 
 He argued with her, tried to dissuade her, said she was still pale,
 fatigued. But the words had no effect. She said that he was too careful
 of her, and he replied that it was impossible.
 
 “When a man has been given a treasure into his keeping ...” She hushed
 him.
 
 They were very happy tonight. Gabriel may still have had a misgiving. He
 knew money ought never to have been paid as blackmail. That the trouble
 should have come through Anne, Anne and her mad religion, was more than
 painful to him. But true to promise he said no further word. He had
 Margaret’s promise that if anything more was heard he would be advised,
 sent for.
 
 When he went back to the hotel that night he comforted himself with
 that, tried to think that nothing further would be heard. Peter
 Kennedy’s name had not been mentioned again between them. He meant to
 persuade her, use all his influence that she should select another
 doctor. That would be for another time. Tonight she needed only care.
 
 He had taken no real alarm at her delicate looks, he had lived all his
 life with an invalid. As for Margaret, there were times when she was
 quite well, in exuberant health and spirits. She was under the spell of
 her nerves, excitable, she had the artistic temperament _in excelsis_.
 So he thought, and although he felt no uneasiness he was full of
 consideration. Before he had left her tonight, at ten o’clock for
 instance, and notwithstanding she wished him to stay, he begged her to
 rest late in the morning, said he would be quite content to sit
 downstairs and await her coming, to read or only sit still and think of
 her. She urged the completeness of her recovery, but he persisted in
 treating her as an invalid.
 
 “You are an invalid tonight, my poor little invalid, you must go to bed
 early. Tomorrow you are to be convalescent, and we will go down to the
 sea, walk, or drive. I will wrap you up and take care of you.
 Monday ...”
 
 “Monday I have quite decided to go up to town.”
 
 “We shall see how you are. I am not going to allow you to take any
 risks.”
 
 Such a different Gabriel Stanton from the one Peter Kennedy knew! One
 would have thought there was not a hard spot in him. Margaret was sure
 of it ... almost sure.
 
 The morphia that had failed her last night put out its latent power and
 helped her through this one. The dreams that came to her were all
 pleasant, tinged with romance, filled with brocade and patches, with
 fair women and gallant men in powder and knee-breeches. No man was more
 gallant than hers. She saw Gabriel that night idealised, as King’s man
 and soldier, poet, lover, on the stairs of that house of romance.
 
 The next day was superb, spring merging into summer, a soft breeze, blue
 sky flecked with white, sea that fell on the shore with convoluted
 waves, foam-edged, but without force. Everything in Nature was fresh and
 renewed, not calm, but with a bursting undergrowth, and one would have
 thought Margaret had never been ill. She laughed and even lilted into
 light song when Gabriel feared the piano for her. Her eyes were filled
 with love and laughter, and her skin seemed to have upon it a new and
 childish bloom, lightly tinged with rose, clear pale and exquisite.
 Today one would have said she was more child than woman, and that life
 had hardly touched her. Not touched to soil. Yet beneath her lightness
 now and again Gabriel glimpsed a shadow, or a silence, rare and quickly
 passing. This he placed to his own failure of temper yesterday, and set
 himself to assuage it. He felt deeply that he was responsible for her
 happiness. As she said, she had altered greatly since they first met. In
 a way she had grown younger. This was not her first passion, but it was
 her first surrender. That there was an unknown in him, an uncompromising
 rectitude, had as it were buttressed her love. She had pride in him now
 and pride in her love for him. For the first and only time in her life
 self was in the background. He was her lover and was soon to be her
 husband. Today they hardly held each other’s hand, or kissed. Margaret
 held herself lightly aloof from him and his delicacy understood and
 responded. Their hour was so near. There had been different vibrations
 and uneasy moments between them, but now they had grown steady in love.
 
 Margaret went up to town with Gabriel on Monday. She forgot all about
 Peter Kennedy eating his heart out and wondering just how harsh and
 dogmatic Gabriel Stanton was being with her. They were going first to
 see the house.
 
 “I must show it you myself.”
 
 “We must see it together first.”
 
 They were agreed about that. Afterwards Margaret had decided to go alone
 to Queen Anne’s Gate and make full confession. She had wired, announcing
 herself for lunch, asking that they should be alone. Then, later on in
 the day, Gabriel was to see her father. In a fortnight they could be
 married. Neither of them contemplated delay. The marriage was to be of
 the quietest possible description. She no longer insisted upon the
 yacht. Gabriel should arrange their honeymoon. They were not to go
 abroad at all, there were places in England, historic, quite unknown to
 her where he meant to take her. The main point was that they would be
 together ... alone.
 
 The first part of the programme was carried out. The house more than
 fulfilled expectations. They found in it a thousand new and unexpected
 beauties; leaded windows and eaves with gargoyles, a flagged path to the
 kitchen with grass growing between the flags, a green patine on the Pan,
 which Margaret declared was the central figure in her group of
 musicians. Enlarged and piping solitary, but the same figure; an almost
 miraculous coincidence. A momentary fright she had lest it was all too
 good to be true, lest some one had forestalled them, would forestall
 them even as they stood here talking, mentally placing print and
 pottery, carpeting the irregular steps and slanting floors. That was
 Gabriel’s moment of triumph. He had been so sure, he felt he knew her
 taste sufficiently that he need not hesitate. The day he had seen the
 house he had secured it. Nothing but formalities remained to be
 concluded. She praised him for his promptitude and he wore her praise
 proudly, as if it had been the Victoria Cross. A spasm of doubt may have
 crossed her mind as to whether her father and stepmother would view it
 with the same eyes, or would point out the lack of later-day luxuries or
 necessities; light, baths, sanitation. Gabriel said everything could be
 added, they had but to be careful not to interfere with the main
 features of the little place, not to disturb its amenities. Margaret was
 insistent that nothing at all should be done.
 
 “We don’t want glaring electric light. We shall use wax candles....” He
 put her into a cab before the important matter was decided. Privately he
 thought one bath at least was desirable, but he found himself unable to
 argue with her. Not just now, not at this minute when they came out of
 the home they would make together. Such a home as it would mean!
 
 Mrs. Rysam was less reticent and Margaret persuadable, but that came
 later. Her father and stepmother were alone to lunch as she had asked
 them. And she broke her news without delay. She was going to marry
 Gabriel Stanton. There followed exclamation and surprise, but in the end
 a real satisfaction. The house of Stanton was a great one. More than a
 hundred years had gone to its upbuilding. Sir George was the doyen of
 the profession of publisher. He was the fifth of his line. Gabriel,
 although a cousin, was his partner and would be his successor. And he
 himself was a man of mark. He had edited, or was editing the Union
 Classics, and had contributed valuable matter to the Compendium on which
 the whole strength of the house had been employed for the last fifteen
 years, and which had already Royal recognition in the shape of the
 baronetcy conferred on the head of the firm.
 
 “Of course it should have been given to Gabriel,” Margaret said when she
 had explained or reminded them of his position. Naturally she thought
 this. They consoled her by predicting a similar honour for him in the
 future. Margaret said she did not care one way or the other. She did not
 unbare her heart, but she gave them more than a glimpse of it. That this
 time she was marrying wisely and that happiness awaited her was
 sufficient for them. Edgar B. looked forward to seeing Gabriel and
 telling him so. He promised himself that he would find a way of
 forwarding that happiness he foresaw for her. Giving was his
 self-expression. Already before lunch was over he was thinking of
 settlements. Mrs. Rysam, a little disappointed about the wedding, which
 Margaret insisted was to be of the quietest description, was compensated
 by talk about the house. Margaret might arrange, but her stepmother made
 up her mind that she would superintend the improvements. Then there were
 clothes. However quiet the wedding might be a trousseau was essential.
",Twilight
45," 
 “Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You
 dragged them from the Serpentine?”
 
 “No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They
 have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the
 clothes were there the body would not be far off.”
 
 “By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in
 the neighborhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive
 at through this?”
 
 “At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”
 
 “I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”
 
 “Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade, with some bitterness. “I am
 afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions
 and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.
 This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”
 
 “And how?”
 
 “In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
 card-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down
 upon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when
 all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been
 that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,
 with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.
 Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt
 quietly slipped into her hand at the door, and which lured her within
 their reach.”
 
 “Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine
 indeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but
 his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of
 satisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.
 
 “Ha! you find it so?”
 
 “Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”
 
 Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he
 shrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”
 
 “On the contrary, this is the right side.”
 
 “The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over
 here.”
 
 “And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,
 which interests me deeply.”
 
 “There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct.
 4th, rooms 8_s._, breakfast 2_s._ 6_d._, cocktail 1_s._, lunch 2_s._
 6_d._, glass sherry, 8_d._’ I see nothing in that.”
 
 “Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,
 it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate
 you again.”
 
 “I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard
 work, and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,
 Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter
 first.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made
 for the door.
 
 “Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes, before his rival
 vanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.
 Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such
 person.”
 
 Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped
 his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
 
 He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose and put on his
 overcoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about out-door
 work,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your
 papers for a little.”
 
 It was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no
 time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s
 man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a
 youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great
 astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out
 upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of
 cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie, with a group of
 ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my
 two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with
 no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered
 to this address.
 
 Just before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.
 His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which
 made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.
 
 “They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.
 
 “You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”
 
 “Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am
 surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that
 I hear his step now upon the stairs.”
 
 It was indeed our visitor of the morning who came bustling in, dangling
 his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed
 expression upon his aristocratic features.
 
 “My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.
 
 “Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have
 you good authority for what you say?”
 
 “The best possible.”
 
 Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
 
 “What will the duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the
 family has been subjected to such humiliation?”
 
 “It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
 humiliation.”
 
 “Ah, you look on these things from another stand-point.”
 
 “I fail to see that any one is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady
 could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was
 undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise
 her at such a crisis.”
 
 “It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping
 his fingers upon the table.
 
 “You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented
 a position.”
 
 “I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been
 shamefully used.”
 
 “I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on
 the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the
 matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more
 successful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.
 “Lord St. Simon,” said he, “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.
 Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”
 
 At the sight of these new-comers our client had sprung from his seat
 and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into
 the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady
 had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but
 he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,
 perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.
 
 “You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause
 to be.”
 
 “Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon, bitterly.
 
 “Oh yes, I know that I have treated you real bad, and that I should
 have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from
 the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was
 doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right
 there before the altar.”
 
 “Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the
 room while you explain this matter?”
 
 “If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had
 just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,
 I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was
 a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean shaven, with a sharp face and alert
 manner.
 
 “Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I
 met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working
 a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day
 father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had
 a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew, the
 poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting
 any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up
 his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa
 knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so
 we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and
 make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as
 much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time, and
 pledged myself not to marry any one else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t
 we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of
 you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we
 talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman
 all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank
 went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.
 
 “The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went
 prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After
 that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been
 attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the
 killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa
 thought I had a decline, and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco.
 Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted
 that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we
 came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased,
 but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the
 place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
 
 “Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my
 duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went
 to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a
 wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just
 as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing
 and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at
 first; but when I looked again, there he was still, with a kind of
 question in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to
 see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning
 round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee
 in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
 a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know
 what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to
 be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that
 he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped
 my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he
 returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when
 he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment
 that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever
 he might direct.
 
 “When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and
 had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a
 few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken
 to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all
 those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain
 afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank
 out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me, and
 then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and
 followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord
 St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a
 little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get
 away from her, and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and
 away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that
 was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a
 prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that
 I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,
 and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”
 
 “I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and
 the church, but not where the lady lived.”
 
 “Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for
 openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should
 like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending
 a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful
 to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that
 breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my
 wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should
 not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find
 them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only
 that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening,
 though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
 clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that
 we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then
 he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and
 so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have
 heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope
 that you do not think very meanly of me.”
 
 Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had
 listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long
 narrative.
 
 “Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most
 intimate personal affairs in this public manner.”
 
 “Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”
 
 “Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand
 and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
 
 “I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a
 friendly supper.”
 
 “I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his lordship.
 “I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can
 hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that, with your
 permission, I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us
 all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
 
 “Then I trust that you at least will honor me with your company,” said
 Sherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,
 for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and
 the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our
 children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country
 under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the
 Stars and Stripes.”
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 “The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes, when our
 visitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how
 simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems
 to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the
 sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than
 the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland
 Yard.”
 
 [Illustration: “‘I WILL WISH YOU ALL A VERY GOOD NIGHT.’”]
 
 “You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”
 
 “From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the
 lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other
 that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.
 Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her
 to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have
 spoken to any one when she was out, for she had been in the company
 of the bridegroom. Had she seen some one, then? If she had, it must
 be some one from America, because she had spent so short a time in
 this country that she could hardly have allowed any one to acquire so
 deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her
 to change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived,
 by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
 American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so
 much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband.
 Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under
 strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.
 Simon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in
 the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as
 the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and
 of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’
 parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a
 prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
 gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous
 husband—the chances being in favor of the latter.”
 
 “And how in the world did you find them?”
 
 “It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in
 his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were
 of course of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it
 to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most
 select London hotels.”
 
 “How did you deduce the select?”
 
 “By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eight-pence for a
 glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are
 not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which
 I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the
 book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the
 day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon
 the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters
 were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and
 being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to
 give them some paternal advice, and to point out to them that it would
 be better in every way that they should make their position a little
 clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.
 I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the
 appointment.”
 
 “But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly
 not very gracious.”
 
 “Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very
 gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you
 found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think
 that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully, and thank our stars
 that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw
 your chair up, and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have
 still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”
 
 
 
 
 Adventure XI
 
 THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
 
 
 “Holmes,” said I, as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down
 the street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that
 his relatives should allow him to come out alone.”
 
 My friend rose lazily from his arm-chair and stood with his hands in
 the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a
 bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still
 lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down
 the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly
 band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of
 the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The gray pavement
 had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so
 that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction
 of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
 whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
 
 He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
 massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed
 in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat
 brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-gray trousers. Yet his actions were
 in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he
 was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man
 gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran
 he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face
 into the most extraordinary contortions.
 
 “What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up
 at the numbers of the houses.”
 
 “I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.
 
 “Here?”
 
 “Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think
 that I recognize the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke,
 the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell
 until the whole house resounded with the clanging.
 
 A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
 gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his
 eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For
 a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked
 at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his
 reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against
 the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away
 to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the
 easy-chair, and, sitting beside him, patted his hand, and chatted with
 him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
 
 “You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You
 are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered
 yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little
 problem which you may submit to me.”
 
 The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against
 his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his
 lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
 
 “No doubt you think me mad?” said he.
 
 “I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.
 
 “God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason,
 so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,
 although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.
 Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming
 together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very
 soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may
 suffer, unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”
 
 “Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear
 account of who you are, and what it is that has befallen you.”
 
 “My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears.
 I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of
 Threadneedle Street.”
 
 The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner
 in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.
 What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens
 of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until
 with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
 
 “I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened
 here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your
 co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground, and hurried
 from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That
 is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little
 exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as
 shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
 
 “It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
 business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
 investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the
 number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out
 money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We
 have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and
 there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon
 the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.
 
 “Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card
 was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the
 name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I
 had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household
 word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted
 names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honor, and attempted, when
 he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the
 air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.
 
 “‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit
 of advancing money.’
 
 “‘The firm do so when the security is good,’ I answered.
 
 “‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have
 £50,000 at once. I could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten
 times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of
 business, and to carry out that business myself. In my position you
 can readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under
 obligations.’
 
 “‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.
 
 “‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most
 certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it
 right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should
 be paid at once.’
 
 “‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own
 private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather
 more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the
 name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,
 even in your case, every business-like precaution should be taken.’
 
 “‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square,
 black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have
 doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’
 
 “‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.
 
 “‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
 flesh-colored velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewelry which he
 had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the
 price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would
 put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am
 prepared to leave it with you as my security.’
 
 “I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity
 from it to my illustrious client.
 
 “‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.
 
 “‘Not at all. I only doubt—’
 
 “‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about
 that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain
 that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter
 of form. Is the security sufficient?’
 
 “‘Ample.’
 
 “‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of
 the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard
 of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all
 gossip upon the matter, but, above all, to preserve this coronet with
 every possible precaution, because I need not say that a great public
 scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to
 it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no
 beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to
 replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and
 I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’
 
 “Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more; but,
 calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £1000 notes.
 When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon
 the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of
 the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no
 doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would
 ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having
 ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
 the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe, and turned once
 more to my work.
 
 “When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so
 precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been
 forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible
 would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,
 therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case
 backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out
 of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab, and drove out to
 my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe
 freely until I had taken it up-stairs and locked it in the bureau of my
 dressing-room.
 
 “And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
 thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of
 the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants
 who have been with me a number of years, and whose absolute reliability
 is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,
 has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent
 character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very
 pretty girl, and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung
 about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her,
 but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
 
 “So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will
 not take me long to describe it. I am a widower, and have an only son,
 Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous
 disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell
 me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died
 I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile
 fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.
 Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,
 but I meant it for the best.
 
 “It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
 business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,
 to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large
 sums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic
 club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a
 number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play
 heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again
 and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
 allowance, that he might settle his debts of honor. He tried more than
 once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but
 each time the influence of his friend Sir George Burnwell was enough to
 draw him back again.
 
 “And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell
 should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him
 to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the
 fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world
 to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a
 brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think
 of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am
 convinced from his cynical speech, and the look which I have caught in
 his eyes, that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,
 and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight
 into character.
 
 “And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when
 my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I
 adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is
 a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager
 and house-keeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could
 be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In
 only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has
",Holmes
46," woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been
 to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back.
 Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely
 dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel
 wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough. This
 circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual
 extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in
 advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an
 impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging
 her to greater exertion.
 
 Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any
 object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider
 passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until
 they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller
 stopped and called impatiently to his companion,
 
 “Come on, can’t yer? What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.”
 
 “It’s a heavy load, I can tell you,” said the female, coming up, almost
 breathless with fatigue.
 
 “Heavy! What are yer talking about? What are yer made for?” rejoined
 the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the
 other shoulder. “Oh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain’t
 enough to tire anybody’s patience out, I don’t know what is!”
 
 “Is it much farther?” asked the woman, resting herself against a bank,
 and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.
 
 “Much farther! Yer as good as there,” said the long-legged tramper,
 pointing out before him. “Look there! Those are the lights of London.”
 
 “They’re a good two mile off, at least,” said the woman despondingly.
 
 “Never mind whether they’re two mile off, or twenty,” said Noah
 Claypole; for he it was; “but get up and come on, or I’ll kick yer, and
 so I give yer notice.”
 
 As Noah’s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road
 while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution,
 the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his
 side.
 
 “Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?” she asked, after they
 had walked a few hundred yards.
 
 “How should I know?” replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably
 impaired by walking.
 
 “Near, I hope,” said Charlotte.
 
 “No, not near,” replied Mr. Claypole. “There! Not near; so don’t think
 it.”
 
 “Why not?”
 
 “When I tell yer that I don’t mean to do a thing, that’s enough,
 without any why or because either,” replied Mr. Claypole with dignity.
 
 “Well, you needn’t be so cross,” said his companion.
 
 “A pretty thing it would be, wouldn’t it to go and stop at the very
 first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up
 after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart
 with handcuffs on,” said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. “No! I shall
 go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop
 till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on.
 “Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I’ve got a head; for if we hadn’t gone,
 at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer’d
 have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady. And serve yer
 right for being a fool.”
 
 “I know I ain’t as cunning as you are,” replied Charlotte; “but don’t
 put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. You
 would have been if I had been, any way.”
 
 “Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,” said Mr.
 Claypole.
 
 “I took it for you, Noah, dear,” rejoined Charlotte.
 
 “Did I keep it?” asked Mr. Claypole.
 
 “No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you
 are,” said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm
 through his.
 
 This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole’s habit to
 repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be
 observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte
 to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be
 found on her: which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his
 innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of
 escape. Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of
 his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.
 
 In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without
 halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely
 judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that
 London began in earnest. Just pausing to observe which appeared the
 most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he
 crossed into Saint John’s Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of
 the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray’s Inn Lane and
 Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst
 that improvement has left in the midst of London.
 
 Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after
 him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole
 external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as
 some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his
 purpose. At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in
 appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed
 over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced
 his intention of putting up there, for the night.
 
 “So give us the bundle,” said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman’s
 shoulders, and slinging it over his own; “and don’t yer speak, except
 when yer spoke to. What’s the name of the house—t-h-r—three what?”
 
 “Cripples,” said Charlotte.
 
 “Three Cripples,” repeated Noah, “and a very good sign too. Now, then!
 Keep close at my heels, and come along.” With these injunctions, he
 pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house,
 followed by his companion.
 
 There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows
 on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at
 Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him.
 
 If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy’s dress, there might have
 been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had
 discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his
 leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting
 so much attention in a public-house.
 
 “Is this the Three Cripples?” asked Noah.
 
 “That is the dabe of this ’ouse,” replied the Jew.
 
 “A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country,
 recommended us here,” said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her
 attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and
 perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise. “We want to sleep here
 to-night.”
 
 “I’b dot certaid you cad,” said Barney, who was the attendant sprite;
 “but I’ll idquire.”
 
 “Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer
 while yer inquiring, will yer?” said Noah.
 
 Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting
 the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the
 travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable
 couple to their refreshment.
 
 Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps
 lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small
 curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the
 last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only
 look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of
 being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between
 which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but
 could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable
 distinctness, their subject of conversation. The landlord of the house
 had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes,
 and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above
 related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening’s business, came into
 the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.
 
 “Hush!” said Barney: “stradegers id the next roob.”
 
 “Strangers!” repeated the old man in a whisper.
 
 “Ah! Ad rub uds too,” added Barney. “Frob the cuttry, but subthig in
 your way, or I’b bistaked.”
 
 Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.
 
 Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass,
 from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from
 the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses
 of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his
 pleasure.
 
 “Aha!” he whispered, looking round to Barney, “I like that fellow’s
 looks. He’d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already.
 Don’t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear ’em
 talk—let me hear ’em.”
 
 He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the
 partition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his
 face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.
 
 “So I mean to be a gentleman,” said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs,
 and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had
 arrived too late to hear. “No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a
 gentleman’s life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.”
 
 “I should like that well enough, dear,” replied Charlotte; “but tills
 ain’t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.”
 
 “Tills be blowed!” said Mr. Claypole; “there’s more things besides
 tills to be emptied.”
 
 “What do you mean?” asked his companion.
 
 “Pockets, women’s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!” said Mr.
 Claypole, rising with the porter.
 
 “But you can’t do all that, dear,” said Charlotte.
 
 “I shall look out to get into company with them as can,” replied Noah.
 “They’ll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you
 yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and
 deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.”
 
 “Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!” exclaimed Charlotte,
 imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.
 
 “There, that’ll do: don’t yer be too affectionate, in case I’m cross
 with yer,” said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity. “I should
 like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of ’em, and
 follering ’em about, unbeknown to themselves. That would suit me, if
 there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman
 of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you’ve
 got,—especially as we don’t very well know how to get rid of it
 ourselves.”
 
 After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot
 with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents,
 nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he
 appeared greatly refreshed. He was meditating another, when the sudden
 opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.
 
 The stranger was Mr. Fagin. And very amiable he looked, and a very low
 bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest
 table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.
 
 “A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,” said Fagin,
 rubbing his hands. “From the country, I see, sir?”
 
 “How do yer see that?” asked Noah Claypole.
 
 “We have not so much dust as that in London,” replied Fagin, pointing
 from Noah’s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two
 bundles.
 
 “Yer a sharp feller,” said Noah. “Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!”
 
 “Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,” replied the Jew,
 sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; “and that’s the truth.”
 
 Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his
 right forefinger,—a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not
 with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large
 enough for the purpose. However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the
 endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put
 about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly
 manner.
 
 “Good stuff that,” observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.
 
 “Dear!” said Fagin. “A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket,
 or a woman’s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he
 drinks it regularly.”
 
 Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he
 fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a
 countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.
 
 “Don’t mind me, my dear,” said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. “Ha!
 ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very
 lucky it was only me.”
 
 “I didn’t take it,” stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs
 like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could
 under his chair; “it was all her doing; yer’ve got it now, Charlotte,
 yer know yer have.”
 
 “No matter who’s got it, or who did it, my dear,” replied Fagin,
 glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk’s eye at the girl and the two
 bundles. “I’m in that way myself, and I like you for it.”
 
 “In what way?” asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.
 
 “In that way of business,” rejoined Fagin; “and so are the people of
 the house. You’ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe
 here as you could be. There is not a safer place in all this town than
 is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so. And I have taken a
 fancy to you and the young woman; so I’ve said the word, and you may
 make your minds easy.”
 
 Noah Claypole’s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but
 his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into
 various uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled
 fear and suspicion.
 
 “I’ll tell you more,” said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by
 dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. “I have got a friend
 that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right
 way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think
 will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.”
 
 “Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,” replied Noah.
 
 “What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?” inquired Fagin,
 shrugging his shoulders. “Here! Let me have a word with you outside.”
 
 “There’s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,” said Noah, getting
 his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. “She’ll take the luggage
 upstairs the while. Charlotte, see to them bundles.”
 
 This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed
 without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off
 with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.
 
 “She’s kept tolerably well under, ain’t she?” he asked as he resumed
 his seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.
 
 “Quite perfect,” rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. “You’re
 a genius, my dear.”
 
 “Why, I suppose if I wasn’t, I shouldn’t be here,” replied Noah. “But,
 I say, she’ll be back if yer lose time.”
 
 “Now, what do you think?” said Fagin. “If you was to like my friend,
 could you do better than join him?”
 
 “Is he in a good way of business; that’s where it is!” responded Noah,
 winking one of his little eyes.
 
 “The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best
 society in the profession.”
 
 “Regular town-maders?” asked Mr. Claypole.
 
 “Not a countryman among ’em; and I don’t think he’d take you, even on
 my recommendation, if he didn’t run rather short of assistants just
 now,” replied Fagin.
 
 “Should I have to hand over?” said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.
 
 “It couldn’t possibly be done without,” replied Fagin, in a most
 decided manner.
 
 “Twenty pound, though—it’s a lot of money!”
 
 “Not when it’s in a note you can’t get rid of,” retorted Fagin. “Number
 and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah! It’s not
 worth much to him. It’ll have to go abroad, and he couldn’t sell it for
 a great deal in the market.”
 
 “When could I see him?” asked Noah doubtfully.
 
 “To-morrow morning.”
 
 “Where?”
 
 “Here.”
 
 “Um!” said Noah. “What’s the wages?”
 
 “Live like a gentleman—board and lodging, pipes and spirits free—half
 of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,” replied Mr.
 Fagin.
 
 Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least
 comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he
 been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected
 that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new
 acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely
 things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought
 that would suit him.
 
 “But, yer see,” observed Noah, “as she will be able to do a good deal,
 I should like to take something very light.”
 
 “A little fancy work?” suggested Fagin.
 
 “Ah! something of that sort,” replied Noah. “What do you think would
 suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very
 dangerous, you know. That’s the sort of thing!”
 
 “I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my
 dear,” said Fagin. “My friend wants somebody who would do that well,
 very much.”
 
 “Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn’t mind turning my hand to it
 sometimes,” rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; “but it wouldn’t pay by
 itself, you know.”
 
 “That’s true!” observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.
 “No, it might not.”
 
 “What do you think, then?” asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.
 “Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not
 much more risk than being at home.”
 
 “What do you think of the old ladies?” asked Fagin. “There’s a good
 deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running
 round the corner.”
 
 “Don’t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?” asked Noah,
 shaking his head. “I don’t think that would answer my purpose. Ain’t
 there any other line open?”
 
 “Stop!” said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah’s knee. “The kinchin lay.”
 
 “What’s that?” demanded Mr. Claypole.
 
 “The kinchins, my dear,” said Fagin, “is the young children that’s sent
 on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay
 is just to take their money away—they’ve always got it ready in their
 hands,—then knock ’em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if
 there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt
 itself. Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 “Ha! ha!” roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.
 “Lord, that’s the very thing!”
 
 “To be sure it is,” replied Fagin; “and you can have a few good beats
 chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like
 that, where they’re always going errands; and you can upset as many
 kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a
 burst of laughter both long and loud.
 
 “Well, that’s all right!” said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and
 Charlotte had returned. “What time to-morrow shall we say?”
 
 “Will ten do?” asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent,
 “What name shall I tell my good friend.”
 
 “Mr. Bolter,” replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such
 emergency. “Mr. Morris Bolter. This is Mrs. Bolter.”
 
 “Mrs. Bolter’s humble servant,” said Fagin, bowing with grotesque
 politeness. “I hope I shall know her better very shortly.”
 
 “Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?” thundered Mr. Claypole.
 
 “Yes, Noah, dear!” replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.
 
 “She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,” said Mr. Morris
 Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. “You understand?”
 
 “Oh yes, I understand—perfectly,” replied Fagin, telling the truth for
 once. “Good-night! Good-night!”
 
 With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah
 Claypole, bespeaking his good lady’s attention, proceeded to enlighten
 her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness
 and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex,
 but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on
 the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLIII.
 WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE
 
 
 “And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?” asked Mr.
 Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into
 between them, he had removed next day to Fagin’s house. “Cod, I thought
 as much last night!”
 
 “Every man’s his own friend, my dear,” replied Fagin, with his most
 insinuating grin. “He hasn’t as good a one as himself anywhere.”
 
 “Except sometimes,” replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of
 the world. “Some people are nobody’s enemies but their own, yer know.”
 
 “Don’t believe that,” said Fagin. “When a man’s his own enemy, it’s
 only because he’s too much his own friend; not because he’s careful for
 everybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There ain’t such a thing in nature.”
 
 “There oughn’t to be, if there is,” replied Mr. Bolter.
 
 “That stands to reason. Some conjurers say that number three is the
 magic number, and some say number seven. It’s neither, my friend,
 neither. It’s number one.
 
 “Ha! ha!” cried Mr. Bolter. “Number one for ever.”
 
 “In a little community like ours, my dear,” said Fagin, who felt it
 necessary to qualify this position, “we have a general number one,
 without considering me too as the same, and all the other young
 people.”
 
 “Oh, the devil!” exclaimed Mr. Bolter.
 
 “You see,” pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, “we
 are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must
 be so. For instance, it’s your object to take care of number
 one—meaning yourself.”
 
 “Certainly,” replied Mr. Bolter. “Yer about right there.”
 
 “Well! You can’t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care
 of me, number one.”
 
 “Number two, you mean,” said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with
 the quality of selfishness.
 
 “No, I don’t!” retorted Fagin. “I’m of the same importance to you, as
 you are to yourself.”
 
 “I say,” interrupted Mr. Bolter, “yer a very nice man, and I’m very
 fond of yer; but we ain’t quite so thick together, as all that comes
 to.”
 
 “Only think,” said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out
 his hands; “only consider. You’ve done what’s a very pretty thing, and
 what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the
 cravat round your throat, that’s so very easily tied and so very
 difficult to unloose—in plain English, the halter!”
 
 Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it
 inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not
 in substance.
 
 “The gallows,” continued Fagin, “the gallows, my dear, is an ugly
 finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has
 stopped many a bold fellow’s career on the broad highway. To keep in
 the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with
 you.”
 
 “Of course it is,” replied Mr. Bolter. “What do yer talk about such
 things for?”
 
 “Only to show you my meaning clearly,” said the Jew, raising his
 eyebrows. “To be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my little
 business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number one, the
 second my number one. The more you value your number one, the more
 careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at
 first—that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do
 so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.”
 
 “That’s true,” rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully. “Oh! yer a cunning
 old codger!”
 
 Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no
 mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a
 sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should
 entertain in the outset of their acquaintance. To strengthen an
 impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by
 acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his
 operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his
 purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter’s
 respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with
 a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.
 
 “It’s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under
 heavy losses,” said Fagin. “My best hand was taken from me, yesterday
 morning.”
 
 “You don’t mean to say he died?” cried Mr. Bolter.
 
 “No, no,” replied Fagin, “not so bad as that. Not quite so bad.”
 
 “What, I suppose he was—”
 
 “Wanted,” interposed Fagin. “Yes, he was wanted.”
 
 “Very particular?” inquired Mr. Bolter.
 
 “No,” replied Fagin, “not very. He was charged with attempting to pick
 a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,—his own, my dear,
 his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. They
 remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner. Ah! he
 was worth fifty boxes, and I’d give the price of as many to have him
 back. You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known
 the Dodger.”
 
 “Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don’t yer think so?” said Mr.
 Bolter.
 
 “I’m doubtful about it,” replied Fagin, with a sigh. “If they don’t get
 any fresh evidence, it’ll only be a summary conviction, and we shall
 have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it’s a case
 of lagging. They know what a clever lad he is; he’ll be a lifer.
 They’ll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.”
 
 “What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?” demanded Mr. Bolter. “What’s
 the good of talking in that way to me; why don’t yer speak so as I can
 understand yer?”
 
 Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the
 vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been
 informed that they represented that combination of words,
 “transportation for life,” when the dialogue was cut short by the entry
 of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face
 twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.
 
 “It’s all up, Fagin,” said Charley, when he and his new companion had
 been made known to each other.
 
 “What do you mean?”
 
 “They’ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more’s a
 coming to ’dentify him; and the Artful’s booked for a passage out,”
 replied Master Bates. “I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and
 a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels. To
 think of Jack Dawkins—lummy Jack—the Dodger—the Artful Dodger—going
 abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box! I never thought he’d
 a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest. Oh, why
 didn’t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out
 as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor
 glory!”
 
 With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master
 Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and
 despondency.
 
 “What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!”
 exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. “Wasn’t he always
 the top-sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him
 or come near him on any scent! Eh?”
 
 “Not one,” replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret;
 “not one.”
 
 “Then what do you talk of?” replied Fagin angrily; “what are you
 blubbering for?”
 
 “’Cause it isn’t on the rec-ord, is it?” said Charley, chafed into
 perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets;
 “’cause it can’t come out in the ’dictment; ’cause nobody will never
 know half of what he was. How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar?
 P’raps not be there at all. Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!”
 
 “Ha! ha!” cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr.
 Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the
 palsy; “see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear. Ain’t
 it beautiful?”
 
 Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of
 Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to
 that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.
 
 “Never mind, Charley,” said Fagin soothingly; “it’ll come out, it’ll be
 sure to come out. They’ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he’ll
 show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers. Think how
 young he is too! What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time
 of life!”
 
 “Well, it is a honour that is!” said Charley, a little consoled.
 
 “He shall have all he wants,” continued the Jew. “He shall be kept in
 the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman. Like a gentleman! With his
 beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he
 can’t spend it.”
 
 “No, shall he though?” cried Charley Bates.
 
 “Ay, that he shall,” replied Fagin, “and we’ll have a big-wig, Charley:
 one that’s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence;
 and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we’ll read
 it all in the papers—‘Artful Dodger—shrieks of laughter—here the court
 was convulsed’—eh, Charley, eh?”
 
 “Ha! ha!” laughed Master Bates, “what a lark that would be, wouldn’t
 it, Fagin? I say, how the Artful would bother ’em wouldn’t he?”
 
 “Would!” cried Fagin. “He shall—he will!”
 
 “Ah, to be sure, so he will,” repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.
 
 “I think I see him now,” cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his
 pupil.
 
 “So do I,” cried Charley Bates. “Ha! ha! ha! so do I. I see it all
 afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin. What a game! What a regular game!
 All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of
 ’em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge’s own son making
 a speech arter dinner—ha! ha! ha!”
 
 In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend’s eccentric
 disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to
 consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now
 looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and
 exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time
 when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of
 displaying his abilities.
 
 “We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,”
 said Fagin. “Let me think.”
 
 “Shall I go?” asked Charley.
 
 “Not for the world,” replied Fagin. “Are you mad, my dear, stark mad,
 that you’d walk into the very place where—No, Charley, no. One is
 enough to lose at a time.”
 
 “You don’t mean to go yourself, I suppose?” said Charley with a
 humorous leer.
 
 “That wouldn’t quite fit,” replied Fagin shaking his head.
 
 “Then why don’t you send this new cove?” asked Master Bates, laying his
 hand on Noah’s arm. “Nobody knows him.”
 
 “Why, if he didn’t mind—” observed Fagin.
 
 “Mind!” interposed Charley. “What should he have to mind?”
 
 “Really nothing, my dear,” said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, “really
 nothing.”
 
 “Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,” observed Noah, backing towards
 the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. “No, no—none
 of that. It’s not in my department, that ain’t.”
 
 “Wot department has he got, Fagin?” inquired Master Bates, surveying
 Noah’s lank form with much disgust. “The cutting away when there’s
 anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there’s everything
 right; is that his branch?”
 
 “Never mind,” retorted Mr. Bolter; “and don’t yer take liberties with
 yer superiors, little boy, or yer’ll find yerself in the wrong shop.”
 
 Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it
 was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter
 that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office;
 that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had
 engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to
 the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of
 having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly
 disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in
 London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which
 he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.
 
 Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much
 greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented,
 with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin’s
 directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner’s
 frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles
 the Jew had at hand. He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well
 garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter’s whip. Thus equipped, he
 was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent
 Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his
 curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow
 as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to
 perfection.
 
 These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs
 and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by
 Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short
 distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the
 office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk
 straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off
 his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on
 alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.
 
 Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually
 followed the directions he had received, which—Master Bates being
 pretty well acquainted with the locality—were so exact that he was
 enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question,
 or meeting with any interruption by the way.
 
 He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who
 were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which
 was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the
 prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in
 the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful
 locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed
 the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they
 could) the full majesty of justice.
 
 There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to
 their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a
 couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the
 table. A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose
 listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency
 to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked
 sternly up to bid some woman “Take that baby out,” when the gravity of
 justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother’s
 shawl, from some meagre infant. The room smelt close and unwholesome;
 the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. There was
 an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the
 dock—the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for
 depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left
 a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the
 thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.
 
 Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were
 several women who would have done very well for that distinguished
 character’s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be
 supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all
 answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen. He
 waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women,
 being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly
 relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once
 could be no other than the object of his visit.
 
 It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big
 coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his
 hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait
 altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested
 in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ’ere disgraceful
 sitivation for.
 
 “Hold your tongue, will you?” said the jailer.
 
 “I’m an Englishman, ain’t I?” rejoined the Dodger. “Where are my
 priwileges?”
 
 “You’ll get your privileges soon enough,” retorted the jailer, “and
 pepper with ’em.”
 
 “We’ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to
 say to the beaks, if I don’t,” replied Mr. Dawkins. “Now then! Wot is
 this here business? I shall thank the madg’strates to dispose of this
 here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for
 I’ve got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man
 of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he’ll go away if I
 ain’t there to my time, and then pr’aps ther won’t be an action for
 damage against them as kep me away. Oh no, certainly not!”
 
 At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a
 view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to
 communicate “the names of them two files as was on the bench.” Which so
 tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master
 Bates could have done if he had heard the request.
 
 “Silence there!” cried the jailer.
 
 “What is this?” inquired one of the magistrates.
 
 “A pick-pocketing case, your worship.”
 
 “Has the boy ever been here before?”
 
 “He ought to have been, a many times,” replied the jailer. “He has been
 pretty well everywhere else. _I_ know him well, your worship.”
 
 “Oh! you know me, do you?” cried the Artful, making a note of the
 statement. “Wery good. That’s a case of deformation of character, any
 way.”
 
 Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.
 
 “Now then, where are the witnesses?” said the clerk.
 
 “Ah! that’s right,” added the Dodger. “Where are they? I should like to
 see ’em.”
 
 This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward
 who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in
 a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very
 old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own
 countenance. For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon
 as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon
 his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner’s name engraved upon the
 lid. This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court
 Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was
 his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had
 disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to. He had also
 remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making
 his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.
 
 “Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?” said the magistrate.
 
 “I wouldn’t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with
 him,” replied the Dodger.
 
 “Have you anything to say at all?”
 
 “Do you hear his worship ask if you’ve anything to say?” inquired the
 jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.
 
 “I beg your pardon,” said the Dodger, looking up with an air of
 abstraction. “Did you redress yourself to me, my man?”
 
 “I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,”
 observed the officer with a grin. “Do you mean to say anything, you
 young shaver?”
 
 “No,” replied the Dodger, “not here, for this ain’t the shop for
 justice: besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with
 the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something
 to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and
 ’spectable circle of acquaintance as’ll make them beaks wish they’d
 never been born, or that they’d got their footmen to hang ’em up to
 their own hat-pegs, afore they let ’em come out this morning to try it
 on upon me. I’ll—”
 
 “There! He’s fully committed!” interposed the clerk. “Take him away.”
 
 “Come on,” said the jailer.
 
 “Oh ah! I’ll come on,” replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the
 palm of his hand. “Ah! (to the Bench) it’s no use your looking
 frightened; I won’t show you no mercy, not a ha’porth of it. _You’ll_
 pay for this, my fine fellers. I wouldn’t be you for something! I
 wouldn’t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask
 me. Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!”
 
 With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the
 collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary
 business of it; and then grinning in the officer’s face, with great
 glee and self-approval.
 
 Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the
 best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting
 here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had
 prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully
 abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not
 been followed by any impertinent person.
 
 The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news
 that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and
 establishing for himself a glorious reputation.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLIV.
 THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE
 FAILS.
 
 
 Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the
 girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of
 the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both
 the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which
 had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was
 trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those
 schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were
 her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and
 deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;
 still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some
 relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp
 he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last—richly as he merited
 such a fate—by her hand.
 
 But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach
 itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix
 itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by
 any consideration. Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful
 inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated
 that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which
 could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a
 refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her—and
",OliverTwist
47," her a cheque for five hundred pounds and told her to fit herself out
 properly. Mrs. Rysam promised house linen. Margaret could not but be
 grateful although the one spoke too much and shrilly, and the other too
 little and to the point.
 
 “What is his income?” Edgar B. asked.
 
 “That’s what I’ve got to learn and see what’s to be added to it to make
 you really comfortable.”
 
 “We shall want so little, Gabriel doesn’t care a bit about money,”
 Margaret put in hastily.
 
 “I daresay not.”
 
 “And neither do I,” she was quick to add. Edgar B. with a twinkle in his
 eye suggested she might not care for money but she liked what money
 could buy. He was less original than most Americans in his expressions,
 but unvaryingly true to type in his outlook.
 
 What an afternoon they had, Margaret and her stepmother! The big car
 took them to Westminster and the West End and back again. They were
 making appointments, purchasing wildly, discussing endlessly. Or so it
 seemed to Margaret, who, exhilarated at first, became conscious towards
 the end of the day of nothing but an overmastering fatigue. She had
 ordered several dozens of underwear, teagowns, dressing-gowns,
 whitewash, a china bath, and electric lights! They appeared and
 disappeared incongruously in her bewildered brain. She had protected her
 panels, yet yielded to the necessity for drains. Her head was in a whirl
 and Gabriel himself temporarily eclipsed. Her stepmother was
 indefatigable, the greater the rush the greater her enjoyment. She would
 even have started furnishing but that Margaret was firm in refusing to
 visit either of the emporiums she suggested.
 
 “Gabriel and I have our own ideas, we know exactly what we want. The
 glib fluency of the shopmen takes my breath away.”
 
 Mrs. Rysam urged their expert knowledge. Whatever her private opinion of
 the house, its size or position, she fell in easily with Margaret’s
 enthusiasm.
 
 “You must not risk making any mistake. Messrs. Rye & Gilgat or
 Maturin’s, that place in Albemarle Street, they all have experts who
 have the periods at their fingers’ ends. You’ve only got to tell them
 the year, and they’ll set to work and get you chintzes and brocades and
 everything suitable from a coal scuttle to a cabinet....”
 
 Margaret, however, although over-tired, was not to be persuaded to put
 herself and her little house unreservedly into any one’s hands. She was
 not capable of effort, only of resistance. Tea at Rumpelmayer’s was an
 interregnum and not a rest. More clothes became a nightmare, she begged
 to be taken home, was alarmed when Mrs. Rysam offered to go on alone,
 and begged her to desist. When the car took them back to Queen Anne’s
 Gate, Gabriel had already left after a most satisfactory interview with
 her father. Edgar B., seeing his daughter’s exhaustion and pallor, had
 the grace not to insist on explaining the word “satisfactory.” He
 insisted instead that she should rest, sleep till dinnertime. The
 inexhaustible stepmother heard that Gabriel had been pleased with
 everything Margaret’s father had suggested. He would settle house and
 furniture, make provision for the future. Whatever was done for Margaret
 or her children was to be done for her alone, he wanted nothing but the
 dear privilege of caring for her. Edgar appreciated his attitude and it
 did not make him feel less liberal.
 
 “And the house? How about this house they’ve seen in Westminster? Is it
 good enough? big enough? He said it was a little house, but why so
 small?”
 
 “They are just dead set on it. Small or large you won’t get them to look
 at another. It’s just something out of the way and quaint, such as
 Margaret would go crazy on. No bathroom, no drains, but a paved
 courtyard and a lead figure....”
 
 “Well, well! each man to his taste, and woman too. She knows what she
 wants, that’s one thing. She made a mistake last time and it has cost
 her eight years’ suffering. She’s made none this time and everything has
 come right. He’s a fine fellow, this Gabriel Stanton, a white man all
 through. One might have wished him a few years younger, he said that
 himself. He’s going on for forty.”
 
 “What’s forty! Margaret is twenty-eight, herself.”
 
 “Well! bless her, there’s a lifetime of happiness before her and I’ll
 gild it.”
 
 “The drawing-room will take a grand piano.”
 
 “That’s good.”
 
 “And I’ve settled to give her the house linen myself.”
 
 “No place for a car, I suppose. In an out-of-the-way place like that
 she’ll need a car.”
 
 So they planned for her; having suffered in her suffering and eclipse,
 and eager now to make up to her for them, as indeed they had always
 been. Only in the bitter past it proved difficult because her
 sensitiveness had baffled them. It was that which had kept her bound so
 long. All that could be done had been done, to arrange a divorce _via_
 lawyers through Edgar B.’s cheque-book. But James Capel, when it came to
 the end, proved that he cared less for money than for limelight, and had
 defended the suit recklessly with the help of an unscrupulous attorney.
 The nightmare of the case was soon over, but the shadow of it had
 darkened many of their days. This wedding was really the end and would
 put the coping stone on their content.
 
 Neither Edgar B. nor his wife heard anything of the attempt at
 blackmail. Gabriel, of course, did not tell them. Margaret, strange as
 it may sound, had forgotten all about it! Something had given an impetus
 to her feeling for Gabriel: and now it was at its flood tide. She had
 written once, “Men do not love good women, they have a high opinion of
 them.” She would not have written it now, she herself had found goodness
 lovable. Gabriel Stanton was a better man than she had ever met. He was
 totally unlike an American, and had scruples even about making money.
 
 Her father and he, discoursing one evening upon commercial morality, she
 found that they spoke different languages, and could arrive at no
 understanding. But she discovered in herself a linguistic gift and so
 saw through her father’s subtlety into Gabriel’s simplicity. She knew
 then that the man who enthralled her was the type of which she had read
 with interest, and written with enthusiasm, but never before
 encountered. An English gentleman! With this in her consciousness she
 could permit herself to revel in all his other attractions, his lean
 vigour and easy movements, shapely hands and deep-set eyes under the
 thin straight brows. His mouth was an inflexible line when his face was
 in repose. When he smiled at her the asceticism vanished. He smiled at
 her very often in these strange full days. The days hurried past, there
 was little time for private conversation, an orgy of buying held them.
 
 Margaret, yielding to pressure and inclination, stayed on and on until
 the week passed and the next one was broken in upon. Now it was Tuesday
 and there was only one more week. One more week! Sometimes it seemed
 incredible. Always it seemed as if the sun was shining and the light
 growing more intense, blinding. She moved toward it unsteadily. This
 semi-American atmosphere into which she and her lover had become
 absorbed was an atmosphere of hustle, kaleidoscopic, shifting.
 
 “If they had only given me time to think I should have known that the
 clothes and the house-linen, the carpets and curtains, the piano and the
 choice of a car, could all wait until we came back, could wait even
 after that. But they tear along and carry us after them in a whirlwind
 of tempestuous good-nature,” Margaret said ruefully in the five minutes
 they secured together before dinner that Tuesday evening.
 
 “You are doing too much, exhausting your energy, using up your strength.
 And we have not found time for even one prowl after old furniture in our
 own way, that we spoke of at Carbies.”
 
 “They are spoiling the house with the talk of preserving it. Today
 Father told me it was absolutely necessary the floors should be
 levelled....”
 
 “I know. And he wants the kitchen concreted. Some wretched person with
 the lips of a day-labourer and the soul of an iconoclast told him the
 place was swarming with rats....”
 
 “We wanted to hear mysterious noises behind the wainscot.”
 
 They were half-laughing, but there was an undercurrent of seriousness in
 their complaining. They and their house were caught in the
 torpedo-netting of the parental Rysams’ strong common sense. Confronted
 and caught they had to admit there was little glamour in rats and none
 at all in black beetles. Still ... concrete! To yield to it was
 weakness, to deny it, folly.
 
 “I have lost sight of logic and forgotten how to argue. There is nothing
 for it but to run away again. Gabriel, I have quite made up my mind.
 Tomorrow, I am going back to Carbies. There are things to settle up
 there, arrange. Stevens is coming back with me, and we are going before
 anybody is up. Every day I have said that I must go, and each time
 Father and Mother have answered breathlessly that it was impossible,
 interposed the most cogent arguments. Now I am going without telling
 them.”
 
 “I am sure there is nothing else to be done. And stay until next week.
 Let me come down Saturday. We need quiet. I feel as if I had been in a
 machine room the last few days.”
 
 “‘All day the wheels keep turning,’” she quoted.
 
 “Yes, that expresses it perfectly. Run away and let me run after you.
 Saturday afternoon and Sunday we will be on the beach, listen to the
 sea, and forget the use of speech.”
 
 “The use and abuse of speech. I’ll wear my oldest clothes. No! I won’t.
 You shall have a treat. I really have some most exquisite things. I’ll
 take them all down; change every hour or two, give you a private
 view....”
 
 “You are lovely in everything you wear. You need never trouble to
 change. Think what a fatigue it will be. I want you to rest.”
 
 “How serious you are! I was not in earnest, not quite in earnest. But I
 can’t wait to show you a teagown, all lacy and transparent, made of
 chiffon and mist....”
 
 “Grey mist?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “I love you in grey.”
 
 She laughed:
 
 “You have had no opportunity of loving me in any other colour. Not
 indoors at least. But you will. I could not have a one-coloured
 trousseau. I’ve a wonderful beige walking-dress; one in blue serge,
 lined with chiffon....”
 
 “Tell me of your wedding-dress. Only a week today....” Before she had
 told him her stepmother bustled in, her arms full of parcels that
 Margaret must unpack, investigate, try on immediately after dinner, or
 before. Dinner could wait. Margaret had already been tried on and tried
 on until her head swam. She yielded again and Gabriel and her father
 waited for dinner.
 
 Nothing was as they had planned it. So, although they were too happy to
 complain, and too grateful to resent what was being done for them, the
 scheme that Margaret should return to Carbies without again announcing
 her intention was hurriedly confirmed between them and carried out.
 
                   *       *       *       *       *
 
 This time Margaret did not complain that the place was remote, the
 garden desolate, the furniture ill-sorted and ill-suited. She was glad
 to find herself anchored as it were in a quiet back-water, out of the
 hurly-burly, able to hear herself breathe. Wednesday she spent in
 resting, dreaming. She went to bed early.
 
 Thursday found her at her writing-desk, sorting, re-sorting, reading
 those early letters of hers, and of his; recapturing a mood. She
 recognised that in those early days she had not been quite genuine, that
 her letters did not ring as true as his. She saw there was a literary
 quality in them that detracted from their value. Yet, taking herself
 seriously, as always, and remembering the Brownings, she put them all in
 orderly sequence, made attempts at a title, in the event of their ever
 being published, wrote up her disingenuous diary. All that day, all
 Thursday and part of Friday, she rediscovered her fine style, her gift
 of phrase. The thing that held her was her own wonderful and beautiful
 love story. And it was of that she wrote. She knew she would make her
 mark upon the literature of the nineteenth century, had no doubt of it
 at all. She had done much already. She rated highly her three or four
 novels, her two plays. Unhappiness had dulled her gift, but today she
 felt how wondrously it would be revived. There are epigrams among her
 MS. notes.
 
 “All his life he had kept his emotions soldered up in tin boxes, now he
 was surprised that they were like little fish, compressed and without
 life.” This was tried in half a dozen ways but never seemed to please
 her.
 
 “Happiness, true happiness, holds the senses in solution, it requires
 matrimony to diffuse them.”
 
 It seemed extraordinary now that she should have found content in these
 futilities. But it was nevertheless true. She came down to Carbies on
 Wednesday and it was Friday before she even remembered Peter Kennedy’s
 existence, and that it would be only polite to let him know she was
 here, greatly improved in health, on the eve of marriage. Friday morning
 she telephoned for him. When he came she was sitting at her
 writing-table, with that inner radiance about her of which he spoke so
 often, her soft lips in smiling curves, her eyes agleam.
 
 Peter had known she was there, known it since the hour she came. He had
 bad news for her and would not hurry to tell her, not now, when she had
 sent for him. In the presence of that radiance he found it difficult to
 speak. He could not bear to think it would be blurred or obscured. If
 the cruellest of necessities had not impelled him he would have kept
 silence for always.
 
 
 
 
                               CHAPTER XIV
 
 
 “Are you glad to see me?”
 
 “I am not sure,” was an answer she understood.
 
 “Surprised?”
 
 “I know you have been down here since Wednesday.”
 
 “You knew it! Then why didn’t you come and see me? You are very
 inattentive.”
 
 “I knew you would send if you wanted me.” Now he looked at her with
 surprised, almost grudging admiration. “Your change has agreed with you;
 you look thundering well.”
 
 “Thundering! What an absurdly incongruous word. Never mind, I always
 knew you were no stylist. Yes, I am quite well, although from morning
 till night I did almost everything you told me not to do. I was in a
 whirl of excitement, tiring and overtiring myself all the time.”
 
 “I suppose I was wrong then. It seems you need excitement.” He spoke
 with less interest than he usually gave to her, almost perfunctorily,
 but she noticed no difference and went on:
 
 “The fact is I have found the elixir of life. There _is_ such a thing,
 the old necromancers knew more than we. The elixir is happiness.”
 
 “You have been so happy?”
 
 She leaned back in her chair, her eyes sought not him but the horizon.
 The window was open and the air was scented with the coming summer, with
 the fecund beauty of growing things.
 
 “So happy,” she repeated. “Incredibly happy. And only on the
 threshold....” Then she looked away from the sky and toward him, smiled.
 
 “Peter, Peter Kennedy, you are not to be sour nor gloomy, you are to be
 happy too, to rejoice with me. You say you love me.” He drew a long
 breath.
 
 “You will never know how much.”
 
 “Then be glad with me. My health has revived, my youth has come back, my
 wasted devastated youth. I am a girl again with this added glory of
 womanhood. Am I hurting you? I don’t want to hurt you, I only want you
 to understand, I can speak freely, for you always knew I was not for
 you. Would you like me to be uncertain, delicate, despondent? Surely
 not.”
 
 “I want you to be happy,” he said unevenly.
 
 “Add to it a little.” She held out her hand to him. “Stay and have tea
 with me. Afterwards we will go up to the music room, I will give you a
 last lesson. Have you been practising? Peter, are you glad or sorry that
 we ever met? I don’t think I have harmed you. You admit I roused your
 ambition, and surely your music has improved, not only in execution, but
 your musical taste. Do you remember the first time you played and sang
 to me? ‘Put Me Among the Girls!’ was the name of the masterpiece you
 rolled out. I put my fingers to my ears, but afterwards you played
 without singing, and you listened to me without fidgeting. Peter, you
 won’t play ‘Put Me Among the Girls’ this afternoon, will you? What will
 you play to me when tea is over and we go upstairs?”
 
 Peter Kennedy, with that strange uneasiness or lambent agony in his
 eyes, eyes that all the time avoided hers, answered:
 
 “I shall play you Beethoven’s ‘Adieu.’”
 
 “Poor Peter!” she said softly.
 
 She thought he was unhappy because he loved and was losing her, because
 she was going to be married next week and could not disguise that the
 crown of life was coming to her. She was very sweet to him all that
 afternoon, and sorry for him, fed him with little cress sandwiches and
 pretty speeches, spoke to him of his talents and pressed him to practise
 assiduously, make himself master of the classical musicians. She really
 thought she was elevating him and was conscious of how well she talked.
 
 “Then as to your profession, I am sure you have a gift. No one who has
 ever attended me has done me more good. I want you to take your
 profession very, very seriously. If it is true that you have the gift of
 healing and the gift of music, and I think it is, you will not be
 unhappy, nor lonely long.”
 
 And the poor fellow, who was really thinking all that time of the bad
 news and how to break it, listened to her, hearing only half she said.
 He did not know how to break his news, that was the truth, yet dared not
 leave it unbroken.
 
 “When is Mr. Stanton coming down?” he asked her.
 
 “Why do you dwell upon it? You have this afternoon, make the best of the
 time. I should like to think you were glad, not sorry we met.”
 
 He broke into crude and confused speech then and told her all she had
 meant to him, what new views of life she had given to him.
 
 “You have been a perfect revelation to me. I had not dreamed a woman
 could be so sweet....” And then, stammeringly, he thanked her for
 everything. He was a little overcome because he was not sure this
 happiness of hers was going to last, that it would not be almost
 immediately eclipsed. He really did love her and in the best way, would
 have secured her happiness at the expense of his own, would have
 sacrificed everything he held dear to save her from what he feared was
 inevitable. He was miserably undecided, and could not throw off his
 depression. Not, as Margaret thought, because of his jealousy of Gabriel
 and ungratified love, but because he feared the wedding might never take
 place. He eat a great many hot cakes and sandwiches, drank two cups of
 tea. Afterwards in the music room he played Beethoven, and listened when
 she replied with Chopin. Or if he did not listen the pretence he made
 was good enough to satisfy her. She was secretly flattered, elated, at
 the effect she had produced, a little sorry for him, a little
 sentimental. “Why should a heart have been there in the way of a fair
 woman’s foot?” she quoted to herself.
 
 She sent him away before dinner. She had promised Gabriel she would keep
 early hours, rest, and rest, and rest until he came down on Saturday,
 and she meant to keep her promise. She gave Dr. Kennedy both her hands
 in farewell.
 
 “I wish you did not look so woebegone. Say you are glad I am happy.”
 
 “Oh, my God!” he lost himself then, kissing the hands she gave him,
 speaking wildly. “If the fellow were not such a prig, if only your
 happiness would last....”
 
 She drew her hands away, angry or offended.
 
 “Last! of course it will last. Hush! don’t say anything unworthy of you.
 Don’t make me disappointed. I don’t want to think I have made a
 mistake.”
 
 With something very like a groan he made a precipitate retreat. He could
 not tell her what he had come here to say, to consult her about, he
 would have to write, or wait until Stanton was there. He wanted her to
 have one more good night. He loved her radiance. She wronged him if she
 thought he was jealous of her happiness, or of Gabriel Stanton, although
 he wished so desperately and so ignorantly that her lover had been other
 than he was.
 
 Margaret had her uninterrupted night, her last happy night. Peter
 Kennedy turned and tossed, and tossed and turned on his narrow bed, the
 sheets grew hot and crumpled and the pillow iron-hard, making his head
 ache. Towards morning he left his bed, abandoning his pursuit of the
 sleep that had played him false, and went for a long tramp. At six
 o’clock, the sun barely risen and the sea cold in a retreating tide, he
 tried a swim. At eight o’clock he was nevertheless no better, and no
 worse than he had been the day before, and the day before that. He
 breakfasted on husks; the bacon and eggs tasted little better. Then he
 read Mrs. Roope’s letter for about the twentieth time and wished he had
 the doctoring of her!
 
   _Dear Dr. Kennedy_:—
 
   I am sorry to say that since I last saw you additional facts have
   come to my knowledge which in fairness to the purity which is part
   of the higher life I cannot ignore. That Mr. Gabriel Stanton had
   been visiting my cousin’s wife during the six months in which she
   should have been penitently contemplating the errors and
   misdemeanours of her past, her failure in true wifeliness, I knew.
   That you had been passing many hours daily with her, and at unseemly
   hours, have also slept in her house, has only now come to my
   knowledge. I am nauseated by this looseness. Marriage should improve
   the human species, becoming a barrier against vice. This has not
   been so with the wife of my husband’s cousin. As Mrs. Eddy so truly
   says “the joy of intercourse becomes the jest of sin.” I return you
   the cheque you gave me and which becomes due next Wednesday. If
   neither you nor Mrs. Capel has any argument to advance that would
   cause me to alter my opinion I am constrained to lay the facts in my
   possession before the King’s Proctor. Two co-respondents make the
   case more complicated, but my duty more simple.
 
   Yours without any spiritual arrogance but conscious of rectitude,
 
                                                           SARAH ROOPE.
 
 “Damn her!” He had said it often, but it never forwarded matters. Time
 pressed, and he had done nothing, or almost nothing. He had received the
 letter Wednesday. On Friday before going up to Carbies he had wired, “Am
 consulting Mrs. C. wait result.”
 
 The early morning post came late to Pineland. Dr. Kennedy had to wait
 until nine o’clock for his letters. As he anticipated on Saturday
 morning there was another letter from the follower of Mrs. Eddy:
 
   _Dear Dr. Kennedy_:—
 
   It is my duty to let you know that I have an appointment with James
   Capel’s lawyer for Monday the 29th inst.
 
 In desperation he wired back, “Name terms, Kennedy,” and paid reply.
 There were a few patients he was bound to see. The time had to be got
 through somehow. But at twelve o’clock he started for Carbies. Margaret
 had not expected to see him again. She had said good-bye to him, to the
 whole incident. Her “consciousness of rectitude,” as far as Peter
 Kennedy was concerned, was as complete as Mrs. Roope’s. She had found
 him little better than a country yokel, and now saw him with a future
 before him, a future she still vaguely meant to forward—only vaguely.
 Definitely all her thoughts were with Gabriel and the hours they would
 pass together. She was meeting him at the station at three o’clock. She
 remembered the first time she had met him at Pineland station, and
 smiled at the remembrance. He might cut himself shaving with impunity
 now, and the shape of his hat or his coat mattered not one jot.
 
 Not expecting Peter Kennedy, but Gabriel Stanton, she was already
 arrayed in one of her trousseau dresses, a simple walking-costume of
 blue serge, a shirt of fine cambric, and was spending a happy hour
 trying on hat after hat to decide not only which was most suitable but
 which was the most becoming. Hearing wheels on the gravel she looked out
 of the window. Seeing Peter she almost made up her mind not to go down.
 She had just decided on a toque of pansies ... she might try the effect
 on Peter. She was a little disingenuous with herself, vanity was the
 real motive, although she sought for another as she went downstairs.
 
 Peter was in the drawing-room, staring vacantly out of the window. He
 never noticed her new clothes. She saw that in his eyes, and it quenched
 any welcome there might have been in hers. It was her expression he
 answered with his impulsive:
 
 “I had to come!”
 
 “Had you?”
 
 “You mustn’t be satirical,” he said desperately. “Or be what you like,
 what does it matter? I’d rather have shot myself than come to you with
 such news....” Her sudden pallor shook him. “You can guess of course.”
 
 “No, I can’t.”
 
 “That blasted woman!”
 
 “Go on.”
 
 “She has written again. Sit down.” She sank into the easy-chair. All her
 radiance was quenched, she looked piteous, pitiable. He could not look
 at her.
 
 “I came up here yesterday afternoon, meaning to tell you. You were so
 damned happy I couldn’t get it out.”
 
 “So damned happy!” she repeated after him, and the words were strange on
 her white lips, her laugh was stranger still and made him feel cold.
 
",Twilight
48," thought it better not to disturb it.
 
 “‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.
 
 “‘In my own bureau.’
 
 “‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the
 night,’ said he.
 
 “‘It is locked up,’ I answered.
 
 “‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have
 opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’
 
 “He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what
 he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very
 grave face.
 
 “‘Look here, dad,’ said he, with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me
 have £200?’
 
 “‘No, I cannot!’ I answered, sharply. ‘I have been far too generous
 with you in money matters.’
 
 “‘You have been very kind,’ said he: ‘but I must have this money, or
 else I can never show my face inside the club again.’
 
 “‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.
 
 “‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonored man,’ said he.
 ‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and
 if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’
 
 “I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You
 shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried; on which he bowed and left
 the room without another word.
 
 “When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was
 safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see
 that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary, but which I
 thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs
 I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and
 fastened as I approached.
 
 “‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did
 you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’
 
 “‘Certainly not.’
 
 “‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has
 only been to the side gate to see some one; but I think that it is
 hardly safe, and should be stopped.”
 
 “‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will, if you prefer it.
 Are you sure that everything is fastened?’
 
 “‘Quite sure, dad.’
 
 “‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her, and went up to my bedroom again,
 where I was soon asleep.
 
 “I am endeavoring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have
 any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any
 point which I do not make clear.”
 
 “On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”
 
 “I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
 particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my
 mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two
 in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It
 had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind
 it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening
 with all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound
 of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all
 palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room
 door.
 
 “‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that
 coronet?’
 
 “The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed
 only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding
 the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending
 it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp, and
 turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the
 gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.
 
 “‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have
 destroyed it! You have dishonored me for ever! Where are the jewels
 which you have stolen?’
 
 “‘Stolen!’ he cried.
 
 “‘Yes, you thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
 
 “‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.
 
 “‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you
 a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another
 piece?’
 
 “‘You have called me names enough,’ said he; ‘I will not stand it any
 longer. I shall not say another word about this business since you have
 chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my
 own way in the world.’
 
 “‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried, half-mad
 with grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’
 
 “‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he, with a passion such as I
 should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the
 police, let the police find what they can.’
 
 “By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in
 my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of
 the coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story, and, with
 a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for
 the police, and put the investigation into their hands at once. When
 the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood
 sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to
 charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
 matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
 national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in
 everything.
 
 “‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would
 be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for
 five minutes.’
 
 “‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have
 stolen,’ said I. And then realizing the dreadful position in which I
 was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honor, but that
 of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened
 to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it
 all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing
 stones.
 
 “‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in
 the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you
 but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the
 beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’
 
 “‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning
 away from me, with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any
 words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called
 in the inspector, and gave him into custody. A search was made at once,
 not only of his person, but of his room, and of every portion of the
 house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of
 them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all
 our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell,
 and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried
 round to you, to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the
 matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
 nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I
 have already offered a reward of £1000. My God, what shall I do! I have
 lost my honor, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”
 
 He put a hand on either side of his head, and rocked himself to and
 fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.
 
 Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted
 and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
 
 “Do you receive much company?” he asked.
 
 “None, save my partner with his family, and an occasional friend of
 Arthur’s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one
 else, I think.”
 
 “Do you go out much in society?”
 
 “Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.”
 
 “That is unusual in a young girl.”
 
 “She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is
 four-and-twenty.”
 
 “This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her
 also.”
 
 “Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”
 
 “You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”
 
 “How can we have, when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in
 his hands.”
 
 “I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the
 coronet at all injured?”
 
 “Yes, it was twisted.”
 
 “Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten
 it?”
 
 “God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it
 is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose
 were innocent, why did he not say so?”
 
 “Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His
 silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular
 points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which
 awoke you from your sleep?”
 
 “They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his
 bedroom door.”
 
 “A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as
 to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of
 these gems?”
 
 “They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the
 hope of finding them.”
 
 “Have they thought of looking outside the house?”
 
 “Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
 already been minutely examined.”
 
 “Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that
 this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the
 police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a
 simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is
 involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his
 bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,
 took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of
 it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the
 thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then
 returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed
 himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is
 such a theory tenable?”
 
 “But what other is there?” cried the banker, with a gesture of despair.
 “If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”
 
 “It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you
 please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote
 an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”
 
 My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,
 which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were
 deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that
 the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it
 did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’s
 judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long
 as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke
 a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin
 upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest
 thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little
 glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into
 a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
 journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence
 of the great financier.
 
 Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back
 a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad
 lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the
 entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into
 a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the
 kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a
 lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds
 at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left
 us standing at the door, and walked slowly all round the house, across
 the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind
 into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into
 the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were
 sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.
 She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,
 which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do
 not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.
 Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.
 As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater
 sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
 more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,
 with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence,
 she went straight to her uncle, and passed her hand over his head with
 a sweet womanly caress.
 
 “You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,
 dad?” she asked.
 
 “No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”
 
 “But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what women’s instincts
 are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for
 having acted so harshly.”
 
 “Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”
 
 “Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect
 him.”
 
 “How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the
 coronet in his hand?”
 
 “Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh do, do take my word
 for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is
 so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”
 
 “I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your
 affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far
 from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London
 to inquire more deeply into it.”
 
 “This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.
 
 “No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the
 stable lane now.”
 
 “The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to
 find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will
 succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin
 Arthur is innocent of this crime.”
 
 “I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove
 it,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his
 shoes. “I believe I have the honor of addressing Miss Mary Holder.
 Might I ask you a question or two?”
 
 “Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”
 
 “You heard nothing yourself last night?”
 
 “Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and
 I came down.”
 
 “You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all
 the windows?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Were they all fastened this morning?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to
 your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”
 
 “Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may
 have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”
 
 “I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,
 and that the two may have planned the robbery.”
 
 “But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker,
 impatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet
 in his hands?”
 
 “Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,
 Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”
 
 “Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met
 her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”
 
 “Do you know him?”
 
 “Oh yes; he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His
 name is Francis Prosper.”
 
 “He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say,
 farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”
 
 “Yes, he did.”
 
 “And he is a man with a wooden leg?”
 
 Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black
 eyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?”
 She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’s thin, eager
 face.
 
 “I should be very glad now to go up-stairs,” said he. “I shall probably
 wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better
 take a look at the lower windows before I go up.”
 
 He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the
 large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he
 opened, and made a very careful examination of the sill with his
 powerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go up-stairs,” said he, at last.
 
 The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with
 a gray carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the
 bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
 
 “Which key was used to open it?” he asked.
 
 “That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the
 lumber-room.”
 
 “Have you it here?”
 
 “That is it on the dressing-table.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
 
 “It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not
 wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a
 look at it.” He opened the case, and, taking out the diadem, he laid it
 upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,
 and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one
 side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three
 gems had been torn away.
 
 “Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds
 to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will
 break it off.”
 
 The banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.
 
 “Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without
 result. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am
 exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to
 break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would
 happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a
 pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards
 of your bed, and that you heard nothing of it?”
 
 “I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”
 
 “But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss
 Holder?”
 
 “I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”
 
 “Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”
 
 “He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”
 
 “Thank you. We have certainly been favored with extraordinary luck
 during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not
 succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I
 shall now continue my investigations outside.”
 
 He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
 unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour
 or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow
 and his features as inscrutable as ever.
 
 “I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,”
 said he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”
 
 “But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”
 
 “I cannot tell.”
 
 The banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried.
 “And my son? You give me hopes?”
 
 “My opinion is in no way altered.”
 
 “Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in
 my house last night?”
 
 “If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning
 between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it
 clearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,
 provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on
 the sum I may draw.”
 
 “I would give my fortune to have them back.”
 
 “Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
 Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again
 before evening.”
 
 It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about
 the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could
 even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I
 endeavored to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to
 some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not
 yet three when we found ourselves in our room once more. He hurried to
 his chamber, and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common
 loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red
 cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
 
 “I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above
 the fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but
 I fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I
 may be following a will-of-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it
 is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef
 from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of
 bread, and, thrusting this rude meal into his pocket, he started off
 upon his expedition.
 
 I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent
 spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it
 down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.
 
 “I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”
 
 “Where to?”
 
 “Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I
 get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”
 
 “How are you getting on?”
 
 “Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since
 I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet
 little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.
 However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable
 clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”
 
 I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction
 than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even
 a touch of color upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened up-stairs, and a
 few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that
 he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
 
 I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I
 retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for
 days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his
 lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,
 but when I came down to breakfast in the morning, there he was with a
 cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim
 as possible.
 
 “You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he; “but you
 remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”
 
 “Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if
 that were he. I thought I heard a ring.”
 
 It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change
 which had come over him, for his face, which was naturally of a broad
 and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed
 to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy
 which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,
 and he dropped heavily into the arm-chair which I pushed forward for
 him.
 
 “I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.
 “Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in
 the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonored age. One sorrow
 comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”
 
 “Deserted you?”
 
 “Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,
 and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last
 night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all
 might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say
 so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:
 
   “‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble
   upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible
   misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this
   thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and
   I feel that I must leave you for ever. Do not worry about my
   future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search
   for me, for it will be fruitless labor and an ill-service to
   me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving       MARY.’
 
 “What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points
 to suicide?”
 
 “No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.
 I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”
 
 “Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned
 something! Where are the gems?”
 
 “You would not think £1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”
 
 “I would pay ten.”
 
 “That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And
 there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a
 pen. Better make it out for £4000 pounds.”
 
 With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked
 over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three
 gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
 
 With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
 
 “You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”
 
 The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he
 hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
 
 “There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes,
 rather sternly.
 
 “Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”
 
 “No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble
 lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be
 proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”
 
 “Then it was not Arthur who took them?”
 
 “I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”
 
 “You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once, to let him know
 that the truth is known.”
 
 “He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview
 with him, and, finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it
 to him, on which he had to confess that I was right, and to add the
 very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of
 this morning, however, may open his lips.”
 
 “For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!”
 
 “I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And
 let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and
 for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George
 Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”
 
 “My Mary? Impossible!”
 
 “It is, unfortunately, more than possible; it is certain. Neither you
 nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted
 him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in
 England—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man
 without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When
 he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her,
 she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil
 knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool, and was in
",Holmes
49," these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were
 occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the
 course of discussion by her companions.
 
 It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the
 hour. Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The
 girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened
 too. Eleven.
 
 “An hour this side of midnight,” said Sikes, raising the blind to look
 out and returning to his seat. “Dark and heavy it is too. A good night
 for business this.”
 
 “Ah!” replied Fagin. “What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there’s none
 quite ready to be done.”
 
 “You’re right for once,” replied Sikes gruffly. “It is a pity, for I’m
 in the humour too.”
 
 Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.
 
 “We must make up for lost time when we’ve got things into a good train.
 That’s all I know,” said Sikes.
 
 “That’s the way to talk, my dear,” replied Fagin, venturing to pat him
 on the shoulder. “It does me good to hear you.”
 
 “Does you good, does it!” cried Sikes. “Well, so be it.”
 
 “Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this
 concession. “You’re like yourself to-night, Bill. Quite like yourself.”
 
 “I don’t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my
 shoulder, so take it away,” said Sikes, casting off the Jew’s hand.
 
 “It make you nervous, Bill,—reminds you of being nabbed, does it?” said
 Fagin, determined not to be offended.
 
 “Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,” returned Sikes. “There never
 was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father,
 and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time,
 unless you came straight from the old ’un without any father at all
 betwixt you; which I shouldn’t wonder at, a bit.”
 
 Fagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the
 sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of
 the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving
 the room.
 
 “Hallo!” cried Sikes. “Nance. Where’s the gal going to at this time of
 night?”
 
 “Not far.”
 
 “What answer’s that?” retorted Sikes. “Do you hear me?”
 
 “I don’t know where,” replied the girl.
 
 “Then I do,” said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because
 he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed. “Nowhere.
 Sit down.”
 
 “I’m not well. I told you that before,” rejoined the girl. “I want a
 breath of air.”
 
 “Put your head out of the winder,” replied Sikes.
 
 “There’s not enough there,” said the girl. “I want it in the street.”
 
 “Then you won’t have it,” replied Sikes. With which assurance he rose,
 locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her
 head, flung it up to the top of an old press. “There,” said the robber.
 “Now stop quietly where you are, will you?”
 
 “It’s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,” said the girl
 turning very pale. “What do you mean, Bill? Do you know what you’re
 doing?”
 
 “Know what I’m—Oh!” cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, “she’s out of her
 senses, you know, or she daren’t talk to me in that way.”
 
 “You’ll drive me on the something desperate,” muttered the girl placing
 both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some
 violent outbreak. “Let me go, will you,—this minute—this instant.”
 
 “No!” said Sikes.
 
 “Tell him to let me go, Fagin. He had better. It’ll be better for him.
 Do you hear me?” cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.
 
 “Hear you!” repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.
 “Aye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have
 such a grip on your throat as’ll tear some of that screaming voice out.
 Wot has come over you, you jade! Wot is it?”
 
 “Let me go,” said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself
 down on the floor, before the door, she said, “Bill, let me go; you
 don’t know what you are doing. You don’t, indeed. For only one
 hour—do—do!”
 
 “Cut my limbs off one by one!” cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the
 arm, “If I don’t think the gal’s stark raving mad. Get up.”
 
 “Not till you let me go—not till you let me go—Never—never!” screamed
 the girl. Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and
 suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with
 him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a
 bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force. She
 struggled and implored by turns until twelve o’clock had struck, and
 then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further.
 With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out
 that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin.
 
 “Whew!” said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face.
 “Wot a precious strange gal that is!”
 
 “You may say that, Bill,” replied Fagin thoughtfully. “You may say
 that.”
 
 “Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you
 think?” asked Sikes. “Come; you should know her better than me. Wot
 does it mean?”
 
 “Obstinacy; woman’s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.”
 
 “Well, I suppose it is,” growled Sikes. “I thought I had tamed her, but
 she’s as bad as ever.”
 
 “Worse,” said Fagin thoughtfully. “I never knew her like this, for such
 a little cause.”
 
 “Nor I,” said Sikes. “I think she’s got a touch of that fever in her
 blood yet, and it won’t come out—eh?”
 
 “Like enough.”
 
 “I’ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she’s
 took that way again,” said Sikes.
 
 Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.
 
 “She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched
 on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself
 aloof,” said Sikes. “We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one
 way or other, it’s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here
 so long has made her restless—eh?”
 
 “That’s it, my dear,” replied the Jew in a whisper. “Hush!”
 
 As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her
 former seat. Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and
 fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.
 
 “Why, now she’s on the other tack!” exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of
 excessive surprise on his companion.
 
 Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few
 minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering
 Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat
 and bade him good-night. He paused when he reached the room-door, and
 looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.
 
 “Light him down,” said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. “It’s a pity he
 should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers. Show him
 a light.”
 
 Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached
 the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the
 girl, said, in a whisper.
 
 “What is it, Nancy, dear?”
 
 “What do you mean?” replied the girl, in the same tone.
 
 “The reason of all this,” replied Fagin. “If _he_”—he pointed with his
 skinny fore-finger up the stairs—“is so hard with you (he’s a brute,
 Nance, a brute-beast), why don’t you—”
 
 “Well?” said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching
 her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.
 
 “No matter just now. We’ll talk of this again. You have a friend in me,
 Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If
 you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog—like a dog! worse
 than his dog, for he humours him sometimes—come to me. I say, come to
 me. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.”
 
 “I know you well,” replied the girl, without manifesting the least
 emotion. “Good-night.”
 
 She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said
 good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look
 with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.
 
 Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were
 working within his brain. He had conceived the idea—not from what had
 just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by
 degrees—that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker’s brutality, had
 conceived an attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her
 repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the
 interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and,
 added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a
 particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him
 at least, almost matter of certainty. The object of this new liking was
 not among his myrmidons. He would be a valuable acquisition with such
 an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without
 delay.
 
 There was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too
 much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the
 wounds were hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him
 off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely
 wreaked—to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life—on the
 object of her more recent fancy.
 
 “With a little persuasion,” thought Fagin, “what more likely than that
 she would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and
 worse, to secure the same object before now. There would be the
 dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place;
 and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back
 it, unlimited.”
 
 These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he
 sat alone, in the housebreaker’s room; and with them uppermost in his
 thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of
 sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There
 was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to
 understand his meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her glance at
 parting showed _that_.
 
 But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and
 that was one of the chief ends to be attained. “How,” thought Fagin, as
 he crept homeward, “can I increase my influence with her? What new
 power can I acquire?”
 
 Such brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a
 confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her
 altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of
 whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs,
 could he not secure her compliance?
 
 “I can,” said Fagin, almost aloud. “She durst not refuse me then. Not
 for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and
 shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!”
 
 He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards
 the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way:
 busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he
 wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy
 crushed with every motion of his fingers.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLV.
 NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION
 
 
 The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for
 the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed
 interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious
 assault on the breakfast.
 
 “Bolter,” said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite
 Morris Bolter.
 
 “Well, here I am,” returned Noah. “What’s the matter? Don’t yer ask me
 to do anything till I have done eating. That’s a great fault in this
 place. Yer never get time enough over yer meals.”
 
 “You can talk as you eat, can’t you?” said Fagin, cursing his dear
 young friend’s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.
 
 “Oh yes, I can talk. I get on better when I talk,” said Noah, cutting a
 monstrous slice of bread. “Where’s Charlotte?”
 
 “Out,” said Fagin. “I sent her out this morning with the other young
 woman, because I wanted us to be alone.”
 
 “Oh!” said Noah. “I wish yer’d ordered her to make some buttered toast
 first. Well. Talk away. Yer won’t interrupt me.”
 
 There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he
 had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of
 business.
 
 “You did well yesterday, my dear,” said Fagin. “Beautiful! Six
 shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! The kinchin
 lay will be a fortune to you.”
 
 “Don’t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,” said Mr.
 Bolter.
 
 “No, no, my dear. The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the
 milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.”
 
 “Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,” remarked Mr. Bolter
 complacently. “The pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was
 standing by itself outside a public-house. I thought it might get rusty
 with the rain, or catch cold, yer know. Eh? Ha! ha! ha!”
 
 Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his
 laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk
 of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.
 
 “I want you, Bolter,” said Fagin, leaning over the table, “to do a
 piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.”
 
 “I say,” rejoined Bolter, “don’t yer go shoving me into danger, or
 sending me any more o’ yer police-offices. That don’t suit me, that
 don’t; and so I tell yer.”
 
 “That’s not the smallest danger in it—not the very smallest,” said the
 Jew; “it’s only to dodge a woman.”
 
 “An old woman?” demanded Mr. Bolter.
 
 “A young one,” replied Fagin.
 
 “I can do that pretty well, I know,” said Bolter. “I was a regular
 cunning sneak when I was at school. What am I to dodge her for? Not
 to—”
 
 “Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and,
 if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street,
 or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the
 information you can.”
 
 “What’ll yer give me?” asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking
 his employer, eagerly, in the face.
 
 “If you do it well, a pound, my dear. One pound,” said Fagin, wishing
 to interest him in the scent as much as possible. “And that’s what I
 never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn’t valuable
 consideration to be gained.”
 
 “Who is she?” inquired Noah.
 
 “One of us.”
 
 “Oh Lor!” cried Noah, curling up his nose. “Yer doubtful of her, are
 yer?”
 
 “She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they
 are,” replied Fagin.
 
 “I see,” said Noah. “Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if
 they’re respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I’m your man.”
 
 “I knew you would be,” cried Fagin, elated by the success of his
 proposal.
 
 “Of course, of course,” replied Noah. “Where is she? Where am I to wait
 for her? Where am I to go?”
 
 “All that, my dear, you shall hear from me. I’ll point her out at the
 proper time,” said Fagin. “You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.”
 
 That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and
 equipped in his carter’s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin.
 Six nights passed—six long weary nights—and on each, Fagin came home
 with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet
 time. On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he
 could not conceal. It was Sunday.
 
 “She goes abroad to-night,” said Fagin, “and on the right errand, I’m
 sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will
 not be back much before daybreak. Come with me. Quick!”
 
 Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of
 such intense excitement that it infected him. They left the house
 stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at
 length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in
 which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.
 
 It was past eleven o’clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly
 on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise;
 and the door was closed behind them.
 
 Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,
 Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of
 glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in
 the adjoining room.
 
 “Is that the woman?” he asked, scarcely above his breath.
 
 Fagin nodded yes.
 
 “I can’t see her face well,” whispered Noah. “She is looking down, and
 the candle is behind her.
 
 “Stay there,” whispered Fagin. He signed to Barney, who withdrew. In an
 instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of
 snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking
 to the girl, caused her to raise her face.
 
 “I see her now,” cried the spy.
 
 “Plainly?”
 
 “I should know her among a thousand.”
 
 He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out.
 Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and
 they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place
 of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.
 
 “Hist!” cried the lad who held the door. “Dow.”
 
 Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.
 
 “To the left,” whispered the lad; “take the left had, and keep od the
 other side.”
 
 He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl’s retreating
 figure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he
 considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the
 better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or
 thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind
 her, pass on. She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk
 with a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative
 distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLVI.
 THE APPOINTMENT KEPT
 
 
 The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures
 emerged on London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid
 step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in
 quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who
 slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance,
 accommodated his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she
 moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the
 ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. Thus, they crossed
 the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman,
 apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers,
 turned back. The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not
 thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses
 which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet
 the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the
 opposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in advance as
 she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again.
 At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. The man stopped too.
 
 It was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that
 hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were,
 hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly
 without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view.
 Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards
 of such of London’s destitute population, as chanced to take their way
 over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless
 hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither
 speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.
 
 A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that
 burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and
 rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks.
 The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull
 from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water
 too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old
 Saint Saviour’s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the
 giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the
 forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of
 churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.
 
 The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro—closely watched
 meanwhile by her hidden observer—when the heavy bell of St. Paul’s
 tolled for the death of another day. Midnight had come upon the crowded
 city. The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the
 chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of
 the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all.
 
 The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by
 a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a
 short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked
 straight towards it. They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when
 the girl started, and immediately made towards them.
 
 They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who
 entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of
 being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate.
 They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it
 immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close
 up—brushed against them, indeed—at that precise moment.
 
 “Not here,” said Nancy hurriedly, “I am afraid to speak to you here.
 Come away—out of the public road—down the steps yonder!”
 
 As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction
 in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and
 roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.
 
 The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the
 Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour’s
 Church, form a landing-stairs from the river. To this spot, the man
 bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after
 a moment’s survey of the place, he began to descend.
 
 These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights.
 Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the
 left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. At
 this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle
 of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who
 chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily
 round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place
 of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he
 slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty
 certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not
 hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.
 
 So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the
 spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he
 had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for
 lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or
 had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious
 conversation. He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place,
 and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and
 directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.
 
 He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely
 breathing, listened attentively.
 
 “This is far enough,” said a voice, which was evidently that of the
 gentleman. “I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther. Many
 people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but
 you see I am willing to humour you.”
 
 “To humour me!” cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.
 “You’re considerate, indeed, sir. To humour me! Well, well, it’s no
 matter.”
 
 “Why, for what,” said the gentleman in a kinder tone, “for what purpose
 can you have brought us to this strange place? Why not have let me
 speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something
 stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?”
 
 “I told you before,” replied Nancy, “that I was afraid to speak to you
 there. I don’t know why it is,” said the girl, shuddering, “but I have
 such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.”
 
 “A fear of what?” asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.
 
 “I scarcely know of what,” replied the girl. “I wish I did. Horrible
 thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that
 has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. I was
 reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things
 came into the print.”
 
 “Imagination,” said the gentleman, soothing her.
 
 “No imagination,” replied the girl in a hoarse voice. “I’ll swear I saw
 ‘coffin’ written in every page of the book in large black letters,—aye,
 and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.”
 
 “There is nothing unusual in that,” said the gentleman. “They have
 passed me often.”
 
 “_Real ones_,” rejoined the girl. “This was not.”
 
 There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the
 concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and
 the blood chilled within him. He had never experienced a greater relief
 than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to
 be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful
 fancies.
 
 “Speak to her kindly,” said the young lady to her companion. “Poor
 creature! She seems to need it.”
 
 “Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me
 as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,” cried the
 girl. “Oh, dear lady, why ar’n’t those who claim to be God’s own folks
 as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth,
 and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud
 instead of so much humbler?”
 
 “Ah!” said the gentleman. “A Turk turns his face, after washing it
 well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after
 giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles
 off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven.
 Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!”
 
 These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were
 perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover
 herself. The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.
 
 “You were not here last Sunday night,” he said.
 
 “I couldn’t come,” replied Nancy; “I was kept by force.”
 
 “By whom?”
 
 “Him that I told the young lady of before.”
 
 “You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on
 the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?” asked the old
 gentleman.
 
 “No,” replied the girl, shaking her head. “It’s not very easy for me to
 leave him unless he knows why; I couldn’t give him a drink of laudanum
 before I came away.”
 
 “Did he awake before you returned?” inquired the gentleman.
 
 “No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.”
 
 “Good,” said the gentleman. “Now listen to me.”
 
 “I am ready,” replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.
 
 “This young lady,” the gentleman began, “has communicated to me, and to
 some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly
 a fortnight since. I confess to you that I had doubts, at first,
 whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe
 you are.”
 
 “I am,” said the girl earnestly.
 
 “I repeat that I firmly believe it. To prove to you that I am disposed
 to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the
 secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks. But
 if—if—” said the gentleman, “he cannot be secured, or, if secured,
 cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.”
 
 “Fagin,” cried the girl, recoiling.
 
 “That man must be delivered up by you,” said the gentleman.
 
 “I will not do it! I will never do it!” replied the girl. “Devil that
 he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do
 that.”
 
 “You will not?” said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this
 answer.
 
 “Never!” returned the girl.
 
 “Tell me why?”
 
 “For one reason,” rejoined the girl firmly, “for one reason, that the
 lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her
 promise: and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has
 led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the
 same courses together, and I’ll not turn upon them, who might—any of
 them—have turned upon me, but didn’t, bad as they are.”
 
 “Then,” said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he
 had been aiming to attain; “put Monks into my hands, and leave him to
 me to deal with.”
 
 “What if he turns against the others?”
 
 “I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him,
 there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver’s
 little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye,
 and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.”
 
 “And if it is not?” suggested the girl.
 
 “Then,” pursued the gentleman, “this Fagin shall not be brought to
 justice without your consent. In such a case I could show you reasons,
 I think, which would induce you to yield it.”
 
 “Have I the lady’s promise for that?” asked the girl.
 
 “You have,” replied Rose. “My true and faithful pledge.”
 
 “Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?” said the girl,
 after a short pause.
 
 “Never,” replied the gentleman. “The intelligence should be brought to
 bear upon him, that he could never even guess.”
 
 “I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,” said the
 girl after another interval of silence, “but I will take your words.”
 
 After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so,
 she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the
 listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by
 name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that
 night. From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as
 if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she
 communicated. When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the
 place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting
 observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the
 habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for
 the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to
 her recollection.
 
 “He is tall,” said the girl, “and a strongly made man, but not stout;
 he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his
 shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don’t forget that,
 for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man’s,
 that you might almost tell him by that alone. His face is dark, like
 his hair and eyes; and, although he can’t be more than six or eight and
 twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and
 disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and
 sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds—why did you
 start?” said the girl, stopping suddenly.
 
 The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious
 of having done so, and begged her to proceed.
 
 “Part of this,” said the girl, “I have drawn out from other people at
 the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times
 he was covered up in a large cloak. I think that’s all I can give you
 to know him by. Stay though,” she added. “Upon his throat: so high that
 you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face:
 there is—”
 
 “A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?” cried the gentleman.
 
 “How’s this?” said the girl. “You know him!”
 
 The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they
 were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.
 
 “I think I do,” said the gentleman, breaking silence. “I should by your
 description. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each other.
 It may not be the same.”
 
 As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he
 took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell
 from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, “It must be he!”
 
 “Now,” he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where
 he had stood before, “you have given us most valuable assistance, young
 woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to serve
 you?”
 
 “Nothing,” replied Nancy.
 
 “You will not persist in saying that,” rejoined the gentleman, with a
 voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder
 and more obdurate heart. “Think now. Tell me.”
 
 “Nothing, sir,” rejoined the girl, weeping. “You can do nothing to help
 me. I am past all hope, indeed.”
 
 “You put yourself beyond its pale,” said the gentleman. “The past has
 been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such
 priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never
 grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it
 is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must
 come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you
 fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the
 compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before
 the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of
 day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your
 former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind
 you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment. Come! I
 would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion,
 or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is
 pestilence and death to you. Quit them all, while there is time and
 opportunity!”
 
 “She will be persuaded now,” cried the young lady. “She hesitates, I am
 sure.”
 
 “I fear not, my dear,” said the gentleman.
 
 “No sir, I do not,” replied the girl, after a short struggle. “I am
 chained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave
 it. I must have gone too far to turn back,—and yet I don’t know, for if
 you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.
 But,” she said, looking hastily round, “this fear comes over me again.
 I must go home.”
 
 “Home!” repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.
 
 “Home, lady,” rejoined the girl. “To such a home as I have raised for
 myself with the work of my whole life. Let us part. I shall be watched
 or seen. Go! Go! If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you
 leave me, and let me go my way alone.”
 
 “It is useless,” said the gentleman, with a sigh. “We compromise her
 safety, perhaps, by staying here. We may have detained her longer than
 she expected already.”
 
 “Yes, yes,” urged the girl. “You have.”
 
 “What,” cried the young lady, “can be the end of this poor creature’s
 life!”
 
 “What!” repeated the girl. “Look before you, lady. Look at that dark
 water. How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the
 tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them. It may be
 years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at
 last.”
 
 “Do not speak thus, pray,” returned the young lady, sobbing.
 
 “It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors
 should!” replied the girl. “Good-night, good-night!”
 
 The gentleman turned away.
 
 “This purse,” cried the young lady. “Take it for my sake, that you may
 have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.”
 
 “No!” replied the girl. “I have not done this for money. Let me have
 that to think of. And yet—give me something that you have worn: I
 should like to have something—no, no, not a ring—your gloves or
 handkerchief—anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet
 lady. There. Bless you! God bless you. Good-night, good-night!”
 
 The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some
 discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to
 determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.
 
 The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.
 
 The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards
 appeared upon the bridge. They stopped at the summit of the stairs.
 
 “Hark!” cried the young lady, listening. “Did she call! I thought I
 heard her voice.”
 
 “No, my love,” replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. “She has not
 moved, and will not till we are gone.”
 
 Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his,
 and led her, with gentle force, away. As they disappeared, the girl
 sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and
 vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.
 
 After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended
 the street. The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for
 some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious
 glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his
 hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in
 the same manner as he had descended.
 
 Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that
 he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and
 made for the Jew’s house as fast as his legs would carry him.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLVII.
 FATAL CONSEQUENCES
 
 
 It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn
 of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets
 are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and
 profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still
 and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so
 distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less
 like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and
 worried by an evil spirit.
 
 He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet,
 with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table
 by his side. His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in
 thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless
 gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog’s or rat’s.
 
 Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.
 Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and
 then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt
 wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon
 the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.
 
 Indeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme;
 hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter
 distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter
 disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of
 detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by
 all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close
 upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain
 of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his
 heart.
 
 He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take
 the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted
 by a footstep in the street.
 
 “At last,” he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. “At last!”
 
 The bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and
 presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who
 carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his
 outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.
 
 “There!” he said, laying the bundle on the table. “Take care of that,
 and do the most you can with it. It’s been trouble enough to get; I
 thought I should have been here, three hours ago.”
 
 Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard,
 sat down again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off the
 robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over
 against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his
 lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions
 which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back
 his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.
 
 “Wot now?” cried Sikes. “Wot do you look at a man so for?”
 
 Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the
 air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the
 moment gone.
 
 “Damme!” said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. “He’s
 gone mad. I must look to myself here.”
 
 “No, no,” rejoined Fagin, finding his voice. “It’s not—you’re not the
 person, Bill. I’ve no—no fault to find with you.”
 
 “Oh, you haven’t, haven’t you?” said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and
 ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. “That’s
 lucky—for one of us. Which one that is, don’t matter.”
 
 “I’ve got that to tell you, Bill,” said Fagin, drawing his chair
 nearer, “will make you worse than me.”
 
 “Aye?” returned the robber with an incredulous air. “Tell away! Look
 sharp, or Nance will think I’m lost.”
 
 “Lost!” cried Fagin. “She has pretty well settled that, in her own
 mind, already.”
 
 Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew’s face,
 and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched
 his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.
 
 “Speak, will you!” he said; “or if you don’t, it shall be for want of
 breath. Open your mouth and say wot you’ve got to say in plain words.
 Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!”
 
 “Suppose that lad that’s laying there—” Fagin began.
 
 Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not
 previously observed him. “Well!” he said, resuming his former position.
 
 “Suppose that lad,” pursued Fagin, “was to peach—to blow upon us
 all—first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having
 a meeting with ’em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe
 every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be
 most easily taken. Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow
 upon a plant we’ve all been in, more or less—of his own fancy; not
 grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on
 bread and water,—but of his own fancy; to please his own taste;
 stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and
",OliverTwist
50," daresay her answer is there by now. I’ll phone and ask if you like.”
 
 “What’s the use?”
 
 “Well, we’d better know.”
 
 “He said that is what would happen. That she would come again and yet
 again.” She was taking things even worse than he expected. “He will
 never give in to her, never....” She collapsed fitfully, like an
 electric lamp with a broken wire. “Everything is over, everything.”
 
 “I don’t see that.”
 
 She went on in that small colourless voice:
 
 “I know. We don’t see things the way Gabriel does. I promised to tell
 him, to consult him if she came again.”
 
 He hesitated, even stammered a little before he answered:
 
 “He ... he had better not be told of this.”
 
 She laughed again, that little incongruous hopeless laugh.
 
 “I haven’t any choice, I promised him.”
 
 “Promised him what?”
 
 “To let him know if she came back again, if I heard anything more about
 it.”
 
 “This isn’t exactly ‘it.’ This is a fresh start altogether. I suppose
 you know how I hate what I am saying. The position can’t be faced, it’s
 got to be dodged. It’s not only Gabriel Stanton she’s got hold of....”
 
 He did not want to go on, and she found some strange groundless hope in
 his hesitation.
 
 “Not Gabriel Stanton?” she asked, and there seemed more tone in her
 voice, more interest. She leaned forward.
 
 “Perhaps you’d like to see her letter.” He gave it to her, then without
 a word went over to the other window, turned his face away from her.
 There was a long silence. Margaret’s face was aflame, but her heart felt
 like ice. Peter Kennedy to be dragged in, to have to defend herself from
 such a charge! And Gabriel yet to be told! She covered her eyes, but was
 conscious presently that the man was standing beside her, speaking.
 
 “Margaret!” His voice was as unhappy as hers, his face ravaged. “It is
 not my fault. I’d give my life it hadn’t happened. That night you had
 the heart attack I did stay for hours, prowled about ... then slept on
 the drawing-room sofa. Margaret....”
 
 “Oh! hush! hush!”
 
 “You must listen, we must think what is best to be done,” he said
 desperately. “Let me go up to London and see her. I’m sure I can manage
 something. It’s not ... it’s not as if there were anything in it.” His
 tactlessness was innate, he meant so well but blundered hopelessly, even
 putting a hand on her knee in the intensity of his sympathy. She shook
 it off as if he had been the most obnoxious of insects. “Let me go up
 and see her,” he pleaded. “Authorise me to act. May I see if there is an
 answer to my telegram? I sent it a little before nine. May I telephone?”
 
 “Do what you like.”
 
 “You loathe me.”
 
 “I wish you had never been born.”
 
 He was gone ten minutes ... a quarter of an hour perhaps. When he came
 back she had slipped on to the couch, was lying in a huddled-up
 position. For a moment, one awful moment, he thought she was dead, but
 when he lifted her he saw she had only fainted. He laid her very gently
 on the sofa and rang for help, glad of her momentary unconsciousness. He
 knew what he intended to do now, and to what he must try to persuade
 her. Stevens came and said, unsympathetically enough:
 
 “She’s drored her stays too tight. I told her so this morning.” But she
 worked about her effectively and presently she struggled back, seeming
 to have forgotten for the moment what had stricken her.
 
 “Have I had another heart attack?” she asked feebly.
 
 “No.”
 
 “I told you you were lacing too tight. I knew what would happen with
 these new stays and things.” She actually smiled at Stevens, a wan
 little smile.
 
 “I feel rather seedy still.”
 
 Peter took the cushion from her, made her lie flat. Then she said in a
 puzzled way, her mind working slowly:
 
 “Something happened?”
 
 There was little time to be lost and he answered awkwardly, abruptly:
 
 “I brought you bad news.”
 
 She shut her eyes and lay still thinking that over. She opened them and
 saw his working face and anxious eyes.
 
 “About Mrs. Roope,” he reminded her. They were alone, the impeccable
 Stevens had gone for a hot-water bottle.
 
 “What is it exactly? Tell me all over again. I am feeling rather stupid.
 I thought we had settled and finished with her?”
 
 “She has reopened the matter, dragged me in.” She remembered now, and
 the flush in his face was reflected in hers. “But it is only a question
 of money. I’ve got her terms.”
 
 “We must not give her money. Gabriel says....”
 
 He would not let her speak, interrupting her hurriedly, continuing to
 speak without pause.
 
 “The sum isn’t impossible. As a matter of fact I can find it myself, or
 almost the whole amount. Then there’s Lansdowne, he’s really not half a
 bad fellow when you know him. And he’s as rich as Crœsus, he would
 gladly lend it to me.”
 
 “No. Nonsense! Don’t be absurd.” She was thinking, he could see that she
 was thinking whilst she spoke.
 
 “It’s my affair as much as yours,” he pleaded. “There is my practice to
 consider.”
 
 She almost smiled:
 
 “Then you actually have a practice?”
 
 “I’m going to have. Quite a big one too. Haven’t you told me so?” He was
 glad to get the talk down for one moment to another level. “It would be
 awfully bad for me if anything came out. I am only thinking of myself. I
 want to settle with her once for all.”
 
 Her faint had weakened her, she was just recovering from it. Physically
 she was more comfortable, mentally less alert, and satisfied it should
 be so.
 
 “Perhaps I took it too tragically?” she said slowly. “Perhaps as you
 say, in a way, it _is_ your affair.”
 
 He answered her eagerly.
 
 “That’s right. My affair, and nothing to do with your promise to him.
 Then you’ll leave it in my hands....”
 
 “You go so fast,” she complained.
 
 “The time is so short; she can’t have anything else up her sleeve. I
 funked telling you, I’ve left it so late.” He showed more delicacy than
 one would have given him credit for and stumbled over the next
 sentences. “He would hate to think of me in this connection. You’d hate
 to tell him. Just give me leave to settle with her. I’ll dash up to
 town.”
 
 “How much does she want?”
 
 “Five hundred. I can find the money.”
 
 “Nonsense; it isn’t the money. I wish I knew what I ought to do,” she
 said indecisively. “If only I hadn’t promised....”
 
 “This is nothing to do with what you promised ... this is a different
 thing altogether.”
 
 He was sophistical and insistent and she was weak, allowed herself to be
 persuaded. The money of course must be her affair, she could not allow
 him to be out of pocket.
 
 They disputed about this and he had more arguments to bring forward.
 These she brushed aside impatiently. If the money was to be paid she
 would pay it, could afford it better than he.
 
 “I’m sure I am doing wrong,” she repeated when she wrote out the cheque,
 blotted and gave it to him.
 
 “He’ll never know. No one will ever know.”
 
 Peter Kennedy was only glad she had yielded. He had, of course, no
 thought of himself in the matter. Why should he? In losing her he lost
 everything that mattered, that really mattered. And he had never had a
 chance, not an earthly chance. He believed her happiness was only to be
 secured by this marriage, and he dreaded the effect upon her health of
 any disappointment or prolonged anxiety. “Once you are married it
 doesn’t matter a hang what she says or does,” he said gloomily or
 consolingly when she had given him the cheque.
 
 “Suppose ... suppose ... Gabriel _were_ to get to know?” she asked with
 distended eyes. Some reassurance she found for herself after Peter
 Kennedy had gone, taking with him the cheque that was the price of her
 deliverance.
 
 Would Gabriel be so inflexible, seeing what was at stake? The last
 fortnight in a way had drawn them so much closer to each other. They
 must live together in that house within the Sanctuary at Westminster.
 _Must._ Oh! if only life would stand still until next Wednesday! The
 next hour or two crushed heavily over her. She knew she had done wrong,
 that she had promised and broken her promise. No sophistry really helped
 her. But, whatever happened, she must have this afternoon and a long
 Sunday, alone with him, growing more necessary to him. Finally she
 succeeded in convincing herself that he would never know, or that he
 would forgive her when he did know, at the right time, when the time
 came to tell him.
 
 She forced herself to a pretence at lunch. Then went slowly upstairs to
 complete her interrupted toilette. Looking in the glass now she saw a
 pale and distraught face that ill-fitted the pansy toque. She changed
 into something darker, more suitable, with a cock’s feather. All her
 desire was that Gabriel should be pleased with her appearance, to give
 Gabriel pleasure.
 
 “I haven’t any rouge, have I, Stevens?”
 
 “I should ’ope not.”
 
 “I don’t want Mr. Stanton to find me looking ill.”
 
 “You look well enough, considering. He won’t notice nothing. The
 carriage is here.” Stevens gave her gloves and a handkerchief.
 
 Now she was bowling along the quiet country road, on the way to meet
 him. The sky was as blue, the air as sweet as she had anticipated. On
 the surface she was all throbbing expectation. She was going to meet her
 lover, nothing had come between them, could come between them.
 
 But in her subconsciousness she was suffering acutely. It seemed she
 must faint again when the train drew in and she saw him on the platform,
 but the feeling passed. Never had she seen him look so completely happy.
 There was no hint or suggestion of austerity about him, or asceticism.
 The porter swung his bag to the coachman. Gabriel took his place beside
 her in the carriage. A greeting passed between them, only a smile of
 mutual understanding, content. Nothing had happened since they parted,
 she told herself passionately, else he had not looked so happy, so
 content.
 
 “We’ll drop the bag at the hotel, if you don’t mind.”
 
 “Like we did the first time you came,” Margaret answered. His hand lay
 near hers and he pressed it, keeping it in his.
 
 “We might have tea there, on that iron table, as we did that day,” he
 said.
 
 “And hear the sea, watch the waves,” she murmured in response.
 
 “You like me better than you did that day.”
 
 “I know you better.” She found it difficult to talk.
 
 “Everything is better now,” he said with a sigh of satisfaction. It was
 twenty minutes’ drive from the station to the hotel. He was telling her
 of an old oak bureau he had seen, of the way the workmen were
 progressing, of a Spode dinner service George was going to give them.
 Once when they were between green hedges in a green solitude, he raised
 the hand he held to his lips and said:
 
 “Only three days more.”
 
 She was in a dream from which she had no wish to wake.
 
 “You don’t usually wear a veil, do you?” he asked. “There is something
 different about you today....”
 
 “It is my new trousseau,” she answered, not without inward agitation,
 but lightly withal. “The latest fashion. Don’t you like it?” Now they
 had left the sheltering hedges and were within sight of the white
 painted hostelry.
 
 “The hat and dress and everything are lovely. But your own loveliness is
 obscured by the veil. It makes you look ethereal; I cannot see you so
 clearly through it. Beloved, you are quite well, are you not?” There was
 a note of sudden anxiety in his voice. “It is the veil, isn’t it? You
 are not pale?” She shook her head.
 
 “No, it is the veil.” They pulled up at the door of the hotel. There was
 another fly there, but empty, the horse with a nose-bag, feeding, the
 coachman not on the box.
 
 “The carriage is to wait. You can take the bag up to my room,” he said
 to the porter. Then turned to help Margaret.
 
 “Send out tea for two as quickly as you can. The table is not occupied,
 is it?”
 
 “There is a lady walking about,” the man said. “I don’t know as she ’as
 ordered tea. She’s been here some time, seems to be waiting for some
 one.”
 
 “Oh! we don’t want any one but ourselves,” Margaret exclaimed, still
 with that breathless strange agitation.
 
 “I’ll see to that, milady.” He touched his cap.
 
 When they walked down the path to where, on the terrace overlooking the
 sea, the iron table and two chairs awaited them, Margaret said
 reminiscently:
 
 “I sat and waited for you here whilst you saw your room, washed your
 hands....”
 
 “And today I cannot leave you even to wash my hands.”
 
 The deep tenderness in his voice penetrated, shook her heart. He
 remembered what they had for tea last time, and ordered it again when
 the waiter came to them: Strawberry jam in a little glass dish, clotted
 cream, brown and white bread and butter. “The sea is calmer than it was
 on that day,” he said when the waiter went to execute the order.
 
 “The sky is not less blue,” Margaret answered, and it seemed as if they
 were talking in symbols.
 
 “How wonderful it all is!” That was his exclamation, not hers. She was
 unusually silent, but was glad of the tea when it came, ministering to
 him and spreading the jam on the bread and butter.
 
 “Let me do it.”
 
 “No,” she answered. When she drew her veil up a little way to drink her
 tea one could see that her lips were a little tremulous, not as pink as
 usual. Gabriel, however, was too supremely happy and content to notice
 anything. He poured out all his news, all that had happened since she
 left, little things, chiefly details of paper and paint and the
 protection of their property from her father and stepmother’s
 destructive generosity.
 
 “It will be all right. I had a chat with Travers.” Travers was the
 foreman of the painters. “He will do nothing but with direct orders from
 us. The concrete in the basement won’t affect the general appearance, we
 can put back the old boards over it. But I think that might be a mistake
 although the boards are very interesting, about four times as thick as
 the modern ones, worm or rat eaten through. They will make the pipes for
 the bath as little obtrusive as possible. The electric wire casings will
 go behind the ceiling mouldings. They are not really mouldings, but
 carved wood, fallen to pieces in many places. But I am having them
 replaced. Margaret, are you listening?”
 
 She had been. But some one had come out of the hotel. Far off as they
 were she heard that turkey gobble and impedimented speech.
 
 “You can tell Dr. Kennedy that I would not wait any longer. Tell him I
 have gone straight up to Carbies. I shall see Mrs. Capel.”
 
 “The lady from Carbies is here, ma’am; having tea on the terrace, that’s
 her carriage.”
 
 Gabriel had not heard, he was so intent on Margaret and his news. The
 sea was breaking on the shingle, and to that sound, so agreeable to him,
 he was also listening idly, in the intervals of his talk. The strange
 voice in the distance escaped him. The familiar impediment was not
 familiar to him. Margaret was cold in the innermost centre of her
 unevenly beating heart.
 
 “Are you listening?” he asked her, and the face she turned on him was
 white through the obscuring veil.
 
 “I am listening, Gabriel.”
 
 “I will go down and speak to her,” Mrs. Roope was saying to the waiter.
 “No, you need not go in advance.”
 
 Margaret’s heart stood still, the space of a second, and then thundered
 on, irregularly. She had no plan ready, her quick brain was numbed.
 
 “Mrs. Capel!”
 
 Gabriel looked up and saw a tall woman conspicuously dressed as nun or
 nursing sister, in blue flowing cloak and bonnet. A woman with irregular
 features, large nose and coarse complexion. When she had said “Mrs.
 Capel” Margaret cringed, a shiver went through her, she seemed to shrink
 into the corner of the chair. “You know me. I wrote to Dr. Kennedy
 Wednesday and the letter required an immediate answer. Now I’ve come for
 it.”
 
 “He went up to London to see you,” she got out.
 
 “I shall have to be sure you are telling me the truth.”
 
 “You can ask at the station.”
 
 Gabriel looked from one to the other perplexedly. But his perplexity was
 of short duration, the turkey gobble and St. Vitus twist it was
 impossible to mistake. He intervened sharply:
 
 “You are Mrs. Roope, my sister’s so-called ‘healer.’ When Mrs. Capel
 assures you of anything you have not to doubt it.” He spoke haughtily.
 “Why are you here?”
 
 “You know that well enough, Gabriel Stanton.”
 
 “This is the woman who blackmailed you?” The “yes” seemed wrung from her
 unwillingly. His voice was low and tender when he questioned Margaret,
 quite a different voice to the one in which he spoke again to the
 Christian Scientist.
 
 “How dare you present yourself again? You ought to have been given in
 charge the first time. Are you aware that blackmailing is a criminal
 offence?”
 
 “I am aware of everything I wish. If you care for publicity my motive
 can stand the light of day.”
 
 “You ought to be in gaol.”
 
 “It would not harm me. There is no sensation in matter.”
 
 “You would be able to test your faith.”
 
 “Are you sure of yours?”
 
 Margaret caught hold of his sleeve:
 
 “Don’t bandy words with her, Gabriel. She says things without meaning.
 Let her go. I will send her away.” She got up and spoke quickly. “Dr.
 Kennedy has gone up to town to see you. To ... take you what you asked.
 When he does not find you in London he will come straight back here.
 They will have told him, I suppose, where you have gone? He has the
 money with him.”
 
 “What are you saying, Margaret?” Gabriel rose too, stood beside her.
 
 “Wait a minute. Leave me alone, I have to make her understand.”
 
 Margaret was in an agony of anxiety that the woman should know her
 claims had been met, that she should say nothing more before Gabriel.
 She did not realise what she was admitting, did not see the change in
 his face, the petrifaction.
 
 “Why don’t you go up to his house, wait for him there?” Then she said to
 Gabriel quickly and unconvincingly:
 
 “This is Dr. Kennedy’s affair. It was Dr. Kennedy for whom you were
 asking, wasn’t it?” Mrs. Roope’s cunning was equal to the occasion.
 
 “It is Dr. Kennedy I have got to see,” she said slowly.
 
 “If he misses you in London he will get back as quickly as possible.”
 Margaret’s strained anxiety was easy to read. Afterwards Gabriel
 followed her, as she moved quickly toward the hotel.
 
 “What has she got to do with Dr. Kennedy or he with her?” he asked then.
 Margaret spoke hastily:
 
 “She sent back the post-dated cheque. It is all settled only they missed
 each other. Peter went up to town to find her and she misunderstood and
 came after him. He has the other cheque with him.”
 
 She was purposely incoherent, meaning him to misunderstand, hoping
 against hope that he would show no curiosity. Mrs. Roope came after
 them, planted herself heavily in their path.
 
 “I’ll give him until the last train.”
 
 “Telephone to your own house and you will find he has been there,”
 Margaret said desperately. “Let me pass.”
 
 “You may go.”
 
 “Insolence!” But Margaret hurried on and he could not let her go alone.
 
 “I will go into the drawing-room. Get the carriage up. We mustn’t stay
 here....” She spoke breathlessly.
 
 “You are not frightened of her?” He hardly knew what to think, that
 Margaret was concealing anything from him was unbelievable, unbearable.
 
 “Frightened? No. But I want to be away from her presence, vicinity. She
 makes me feel ill....”
 
 Margaret thought the danger was averted, or would be if she could get
 away without any more explanation. She had obscured the issue. Peter
 Kennedy would come back and pay all that was asked. Gabriel would never
 know that it was the second and not the first attempt at blackmailing
 from which they were suffering. But she underrated his intelligence, he
 was not at all so easily put off. He got the carriage round and put her
 in it, enwrapping her with the same care as always. He was very silent,
 however, as they drove homeward and his expression was inscrutable. She
 questioned his face but without result, put out her hand and he held it.
 
 “We are not still thinking of Mrs. Roope, Gabriel?”
 
 “Have you seen her since I was here last?” he asked.
 
 “Not until she came up to us this afternoon.” She was glad to be able to
 answer that truthfully, breathed more freely.
 
 “Nor heard from her?”
 
 “Nor heard from her.”
 
 “How did you know Dr. Kennedy had gone up to town to see her?”
 
 “He told me so this morning. I ... I advised him to go.”
 
 “Was this morning the first time you saw him?”
 
 “No, I saw him yesterday. Am I under cross-examination?” She tried to
 smile, speak lightly, but Gabriel sat up by her side without response.
 His face was set in harsh lines. She loved him greatly but feared him a
 little too, and put forth her powers, talking lightly and of light
 things. He came back to the subject and persisted:
 
 “Why did she send back the post-dated cheque? Had she another given
 her?”
 
 “I ... I suppose so.”
 
 “Why?”
 
 “I don’t like the way you are talking to me.” She pouted, and he
 relapsed into silence.
 
 When they got back to Carbies she said she must go up and change her
 dress. She was very shaken by his attitude: she thought his self-control
",Twilight
51," all perfectly true.
 
 “Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you, but
 he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
 In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so
 he rose, and looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking
 very stealthily along the passage, until she disappeared into your
 dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some
 clothes, and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this
 strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the
 light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious
 coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling
 with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,
 whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her
 stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to some one in the
 gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing
 quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
 
 “As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without
 a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that
 she was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for
 you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just
 as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the
 snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the
 moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught
 him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one
 side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,
 your son struck Sir George, and cut him over the eye. Then something
 suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his
 hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had
 just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle, and
 was endeavoring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”
 
 “Is it possible?” gasped the banker.
 
 “You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he
 felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain
 the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved
 little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous
 view, however, and preserved her secret.”
 
 “And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,”
 cried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his
 asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted
 to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How
 cruelly I have misjudged him!”
 
 “When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very
 carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow
 which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening
 before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve
 impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all
 trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the
 far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,
 whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.
 I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run
 back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel
 marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away.
 I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart,
 of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.
 I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random
 tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
 lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of
 me.
 
 “There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double
 line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was
 at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your
 son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly,
 and, as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot,
 it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up,
 and found that they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all
 the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was
 a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced
 round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,
 and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I
 was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little
 smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came
 to the high-road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been
 cleared, so there was an end to that clew.
 
 “On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill
 and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once
 see that some one had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of
 an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then
 beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man
 had waited outside the window, some one had brought the gems; the deed
 had been overseen by your son, he had pursued the thief, had struggled
 with him, they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength
 causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had
 returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his
 opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man,
 and who was it brought him the coronet?
 
 “It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,
 whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew
 that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained
 your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son
 allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible
 reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent
 explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret
 was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at
 that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my
 conjecture became a certainty.
 
 “And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for
 who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to
 you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends
 was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had
 heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It
 must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.
 Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still
 flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word
 without compromising his own family.
 
 “Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I
 went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick
 up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his
 head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,
 made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I
 journeyed down to Streatham, and saw that they exactly fitted the
 tracks.”
 
 [Illustration: “I CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD”]
 
 “I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr.
 Holder.
 
 “Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and
 changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,
 for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I
 knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the
 matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.
 But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to
 bluster, and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,
 however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.
 Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
 him a price for the stones he held—£1000 apiece. That brought out the
 first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he,
 ‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get
 the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there
 would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I
 got our stones at £1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told
 him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock,
 after what I may call a really hard day’s work.”
 
 “A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the
 banker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall
 not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed
 exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy
 to apologize to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you
 tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can
 inform me where she is now.”
 
 “I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is
 wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
 whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient
 punishment.”
 
 
 
 
 Adventure XII
 
 THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
 
 
 “To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,
 tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, “it is
 frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the
 keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,
 Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little
 records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I
 am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence
 not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in
 which I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been
 trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties
 of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special
 province.”
 
 “And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from
 the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”
 
 “You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with
 the tongs, and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was
 wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious, rather than a
 meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put color and
 life into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the
 task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect
 which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”
 
 “It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I
 remarked, with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which
 I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s
 singular character.
 
 “No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his
 wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my
 art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.
 Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather
 than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what
 should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”
 
 It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast
 on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A
 thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-colored houses, and the
 opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy
 yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit, and shone on the white cloth and
 glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.
 Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously
 into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers, until at
 last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very
 sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
 
 “At the same time,” he remarked, after a pause, during which he had sat
 puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly
 be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you
 have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not
 treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I
 endeavored to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss
 Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted
 lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
 outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear
 that you may have bordered on the trivial.”
 
 “The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I hold to have
 been novel and of interest.”
 
 “Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
 public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by
 his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!
 But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of
 the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all
 enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to
 be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and
 giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I
 have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning
 marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter
 across to me.
 
 It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran
 thus:
 
   “DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as
   to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has
   been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten
   to-morrow, if I do not inconvenience you.
 
   “Yours faithfully,     VIOLET HUNTER.”
 
 “Do you know the young lady?” I asked.
 
 “Not I.”
 
 “It is half-past ten now.”
 
 “Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”
 
 “It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember
 that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim
 at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this
 case, also.”
 
 “Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for
 here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”
 
 As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was
 plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a
 plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own
 way to make in the world.
 
 “You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my
 companion rose to greet her; “but I have had a very strange experience,
 and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask
 advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what
 I should do.”
 
 “Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I
 can to serve you.”
 
 I could see that Holmes was favorably impressed by the manner and
 speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,
 and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger tips
 together, to listen to her story.
 
 “I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family
 of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an
 appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over
 to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I
 advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last
 the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my
 wits’ end as to what I should do.
 
 “There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called
 Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to
 see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was
 the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by
 Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are
 seeking employment wait in an ante-room, and are then shown in one by
 one, when she consults her ledgers, and sees whether she has anything
 which would suit them.
 
 “Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as
 usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout
 man with a very smiling face, and a great heavy chin which rolled down
 in fold upon fold over his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of
 glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.
 As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair, and turned quickly to
 Miss Stoper:
 
 “‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better. Capital!
 capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic, and rubbed his hands together
 in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that
 it was quite a pleasure to look at him.
 
 “‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.
 
 “‘Yes, sir.’
 
 “‘As governess?’
 
 “‘Yes, sir.’
 
 “‘And what salary do you ask?’
 
 “‘I had £4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’
 
 “‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat
 hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How
 could any one offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions
 and accomplishments?’
 
 “‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A
 little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’
 
 “‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The
 point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a
 lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted
 for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part
 in the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could
 any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three
 figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £100 a year.’
 
 “You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an
 offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing
 perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and
 took out a note.
 
 “‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion
 until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white
 creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary
 beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey
 and their wardrobe.’
 
 “It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful
 a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a
 great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the
 whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I
 quite committed myself.
 
 “‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.
 
 “‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the
 far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young
 lady, and the dearest old country-house.’
 
 “‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’
 
 “‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could
 see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three
 gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed
 his eyes into his head again.
 
 “I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but
 the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.
 
 “‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’
 
 “‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried.
 ‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to
 obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they
 were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no
 difficulty, heh?’
 
 “‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’
 
 “‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you
 know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which
 we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’
 
 “‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.
 
 “‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’
 
 “‘Oh, no.’
 
 “‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’
 
 “I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my
 hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.
 It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in
 this off-hand fashion.
 
 “‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been
 watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow
 pass over his face as I spoke.
 
 “‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little
 fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’
 fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’
 
 “‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered, firmly.
 
 “‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,
 because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In
 that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young
 ladies.’
 
 “The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a
 word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance
 upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a
 handsome commission through my refusal.
 
 “‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.
 
 “‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’
 
 “‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most
 excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she, sharply. ‘You can hardly
 expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.
 Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I
 was shown out by the page.
 
 “Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little
 enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began
 to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,
 if these people had strange fads, and expected obedience on the most
 extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their
 eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £100 a
 year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by
 wearing it short, and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I
 was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after
 I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride, so far as to go back
 to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open, when I
 received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here, and I
 will read it to you:
 
     “‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
 
     “‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your
     address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have
     reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you
     should come, for she has been much attracted by my description
     of you. We are willing to give £30 a quarter, or £120 a year, so
     as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads
     may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife
     is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like
     you to wear such a dress in-doors in the morning. You need not,
     however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one
     belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which
     would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting
     here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that
     need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is
     no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its
     beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must
     remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased
     salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as
     the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and
     I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know
     your train.         Yours faithfully,      JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’
 
 “That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind
 is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before
 taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your
 consideration.”
 
 “Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
 question,” said Holmes, smiling.
 
 “But you would not advise me to refuse?”
 
 “I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a
 sister of mine apply for.”
 
 “What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”
 
 “Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed
 some opinion?”
 
 “Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle
 seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his
 wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear
 she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humors her fancies in
 every way in order to prevent an outbreak.”
 
 “That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most
 probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household
 for a young lady.”
 
 “But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”
 
 “Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes
 me uneasy. Why should they give you £120 a year, when they could have
 their pick for £40? There must be some strong reason behind.”
 
 “I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand
 afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I
 felt that you were at the back of me.”
 
 “Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your
 little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my
 way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of
 the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”
 
 “Danger! What danger do you foresee?”
 
 Holmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we
 could define it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram
 would bring me down to your help.”
 
 “That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety
 all swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in
 my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor
 hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful
 words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her
 way.
 
 “At least,” said I, as we heard her quick, firm step descending the
 stairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take
 care of herself.”
 
 “And she would need to be,” said Holmes, gravely; “I am much mistaken
 if we do not hear from her before many days are past.”
 
 It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A
 fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning
 in her direction, and wondering what strange side-alley of human
 experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary,
 the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something
 abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were
 a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to
 determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an
 hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the
 matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data!
 data!” he cried, impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And
 yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should
 ever have accepted such a situation.
 
 The telegram which we eventually received came late one night, just as
 I was thinking of turning in, and Holmes was settling down to one of
 those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in,
 when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night,
 and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in
 the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the
 message, threw it across to me.
 
 “Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his
 chemical studies.
 
 The summons was a brief and urgent one.
 
   “Please be at the ‘Black Swan’ Hotel at Winchester at
   mid-day to-morrow,” it said. “Do come! I am at my wits’
   end.                                       HUNTER.”
 
 “Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.
 
 “I should wish to.”
 
 “Just look it up, then.”
 
 “There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my
 Bradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11.30.”
 
 “That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
 analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
 morning.”
 
        *       *       *       *       *
 
 By eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old
 English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the
 way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them
 down, and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a
 light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across
 from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was
 an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.
 All over the country-side, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,
 the little red and gray roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from
 amid the light green of the new foliage.
 
 “Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried, with all the enthusiasm of
 a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
 
 But Holmes shook his head gravely.
 
 “Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind
 with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to
 my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are
 impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which
 comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with
 which crime may be committed there.”
 
 “Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old
 homesteads?”
 
 “They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,
 founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London
 do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and
 beautiful country-side.”
 
 “You horrify me!”
 
 “But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can
 do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so
 vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s
 blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbors, and
 then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of
 complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime
 and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,
 filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of
",Holmes
52," the mere suggestion. “I’d do something in the jail that ’ud get me put
 in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I’d fall upon you with
 them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I
 should have such strength,” muttered the robber, poising his brawny
 arm, “that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over
 it.”
 
 “You would?”
 
 “Would I!” said the housebreaker. “Try me.”
 
 “If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or—”
 
 “I don’t care who,” replied Sikes impatiently. “Whoever it was, I’d
 serve them the same.”
 
 Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent,
 stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse
 him. Sikes leant forward in his chair: looking on with his hands upon
 his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and
 preparation was to end in.
 
 “Bolter, Bolter! Poor lad!” said Fagin, looking up with an expression
 of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.
 “He’s tired—tired with watching for her so long,—watching for _her_,
 Bill.”
 
 “Wot d’ye mean?” asked Sikes, drawing back.
 
 Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him
 into a sitting posture. When his assumed name had been repeated several
 times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily
 about him.
 
 “Tell me that again—once again, just for him to hear,” said the Jew,
 pointing to Sikes as he spoke.
 
 “Tell yer what?” asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.
 
 “That about— _Nancy_,” said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if
 to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough. “You
 followed her?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “To London Bridge?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Where she met two people.”
 
 “So she did.”
 
 “A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before,
 who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she
 did—and to describe him, which she did—and to tell her what house it
 was that we meet at, and go to, which she did—and where it could be
 best watched from, which she did—and what time the people went there,
 which she did. She did all this. She told it all every word without a
 threat, without a murmur—she did—did she not?” cried Fagin, half mad
 with fury.
 
 “All right,” replied Noah, scratching his head. “That’s just what it
 was!”
 
 “What did they say, about last Sunday?”
 
 “About last Sunday!” replied Noah, considering. “Why I told yer that
 before.”
 
 “Again. Tell it again!” cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and
 brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.
 
 “They asked her,” said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to
 have a dawning perception who Sikes was, “they asked her why she didn’t
 come, last Sunday, as she promised. She said she couldn’t.”
 
 “Why—why? Tell him that.”
 
 “Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told
 them of before,” replied Noah.
 
 “What more of him?” cried Fagin. “What more of the man she had told
 them of before? Tell him that, tell him that.”
 
 “Why, that she couldn’t very easily get out of doors unless he knew
 where she was going to,” said Noah; “and so the first time she went to
 see the lady, she—ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that
 it did—she gave him a drink of laudanum.”
 
 “Hell’s fire!” cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew. “Let me
 go!”
 
 Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted,
 wildly and furiously, up the stairs.
 
 “Bill, Bill!” cried Fagin, following him hastily. “A word. Only a
 word.”
 
 The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was
 unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and
 violence, when the Jew came panting up.
 
 “Let me out,” said Sikes. “Don’t speak to me; it’s not safe. Let me
 out, I say!”
 
 “Hear me speak a word,” rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.
 “You won’t be—”
 
 “Well,” replied the other.
 
 “You won’t be—too—violent, Bill?”
 
 The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see
 each other’s faces. They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire
 in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.
 
 “I mean,” said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now
 useless, “not too violent for safety. Be crafty, Bill, and not too
 bold.”
 
 Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had
 turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.
 
 Without one pause, or moment’s consideration; without once turning his
 head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering
 them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage
 resolution: his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw
 seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong
 course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his
 own door. He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the
 stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting
 a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.
 
 The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it. He had roused her from her
 sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.
 
 “Get up!” said the man.
 
 “It is you, Bill!” said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his
 return.
 
 “It is,” was the reply. “Get up.”
 
 There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the
 candlestick, and hurled it under the grate. Seeing the faint light of
 early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.
 
 “Let it be,” said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. “There’s enough
 light for wot I’ve got to do.”
 
 “Bill,” said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, “why do you look like
 that at me!”
 
 The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils
 and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat,
 dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the
 door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.
 
 “Bill, Bill!” gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal
 fear,—“I—I won’t scream or cry—not once—hear me—speak to me—tell me
 what I have done!”
 
 “You know, you she devil!” returned the robber, suppressing his breath.
 “You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.”
 
 “Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,”
 rejoined the girl, clinging to him. “Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have
 the heart to kill me. Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one
 night, for you. You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this
 crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off. Bill, Bill,
 for dear God’s sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my
 blood! I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!”
 
 The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl
 were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear
 them away.
 
 “Bill,” cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, “the
 gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some
 foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. Let me
 see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and
 goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far
 apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in
 prayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent.
 They told me so—I feel it now—but we must have time—a little, little
 time!”
 
 The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty
 of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the
 midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could
 summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own.
 
 She staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down
 from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty,
 on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief—Rose Maylie’s
 own—and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as
 her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her
 Maker.
 
 It was a ghastly figure to look upon. The murderer staggering backward
 to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy
 club and struck her down.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLVIII.
 THE FLIGHT OF SIKES
 
 
 Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed
 within wide London’s bounds since night hung over it, that was the
 worst. Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning
 air, that was the foulest and most cruel.
 
 The sun—the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new
 life, and hope, and freshness to man—burst upon the crowded city in
 clear and radiant glory. Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended
 window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal
 ray. It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. It did. He
 tried to shut it out, but it would stream in. If the sight had been a
 ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that
 brilliant light!
 
 He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. There had been a moan and
 motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and
 struck again. Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy
 the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring
 upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered
 and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling. He had plucked it off again.
 And there was the body—mere flesh and blood, no more—but such flesh,
 and so much blood!
 
 He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There
 was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder,
 and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney. Even that frightened
 him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then
 piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes. He washed
 himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be
 removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. How those stains
 were dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were bloody.
 
 All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no,
 not for a moment. Such preparations completed, he moved, backward,
 towards the door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his
 feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He
 shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.
 
 He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing
 was visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which
 she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay
 nearly under there. _He_ knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon
 the very spot!
 
 The glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the
 room. He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.
 
 He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which
 stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate
 Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the
 right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the
 foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on
 Hampstead Heath. Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted
 the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of
 Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath
 to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under
 a hedge, and slept.
 
 Soon he was up again, and away,—not far into the country, but back
 towards London by the high-road—then back again—then over another part
 of the same ground as he already traversed—then wandering up and down
 in fields, and lying on ditches’ brinks to rest, and starting up to
 make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.
 
 Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat
 and drink? Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most
 people’s way. Thither he directed his steps,—running sometimes, and
 sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail’s pace, or
 stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. But when
 he got there, all the people he met—the very children at the
 doors—seemed to view him with suspicion. Back he turned again, without
 the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for
 many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to
 go.
 
 He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the
 old place. Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane,
 and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round,
 and still lingered about the same spot. At last he got away, and shaped
 his course for Hatfield.
 
 It was nine o’clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the
 dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the
 hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little
 street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided
 them to the spot. There was a fire in the tap-room, and some
 country-labourers were drinking before it.
 
 They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest
 corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he
 cast a morsel of food from time to time.
 
 The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the
 neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted,
 upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous
 Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men
 present declaring him to have been quite young—not older, one
 white-haired grandfather said, than he was—with ten or fifteen year of
 life in him at least—if he had taken care; if he had taken care.
 
 There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The
 robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his
 corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the
 noisy entrance of a new comer.
 
 This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who
 travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors,
 washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap
 perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case
 slung to his back. His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes
 with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper,
 and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite
 business with amusement.
 
 “And what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?” asked a grinning
 countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.
 
 “This,” said the fellow, producing one, “this is the infallible and
 invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt,
 mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen,
 cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or
 woollen stuff. Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains,
 paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with
 the infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour,
 she has only need to swallow one cake and she’s cured at once—for it’s
 poison. If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt
 one little square, and he has put it beyond question—for it’s quite as
 satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the
 flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. One penny a square.
 With all these virtues, one penny a square!”
 
 There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly
 hesitated. The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.
 
 “It’s all bought up as fast as it can be made,” said the fellow. “There
 are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery,
 always a-working upon it, and they can’t make it fast enough, though
 the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned
 directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a
 premium of fifty for twins. One penny a square! Two half-pence is all
 the same, and four farthings is received with joy. One penny a square!
 Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains,
 pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of
 a gentleman in company, that I’ll take clean out, before he can order
 me a pint of ale.”
 
 “Hah!” cried Sikes starting up. “Give that back.”
 
 “I’ll take it clean out, sir,” replied the man, winking to the company,
 “before you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe
 the dark stain upon this gentleman’s hat, no wider than a shilling, but
 thicker than a half-crown. Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain,
 beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or
 blood-stain—”
 
 The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew
 the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.
 
 With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened
 upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was
 not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken
 sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of
 the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking
 past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was
 standing at the little post-office. He almost knew what was to come;
 but he crossed over, and listened.
 
 The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man,
 dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a
 basket which lay ready on the pavement.
 
 “That’s for your people,” said the guard. “Now, look alive in there,
 will you. Damn that ’ere bag, it warn’t ready night afore last; this
 won’t do, you know!”
 
 “Anything new up in town, Ben?” asked the game-keeper, drawing back to
 the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.
 
 “No, nothing that I knows on,” replied the man, pulling on his gloves.
 “Corn’s up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields
 way, but I don’t reckon much upon it.”
 
 “Oh, that’s quite true,” said a gentleman inside, who was looking out
 of the window. “And a dreadful murder it was.”
 
 “Was it, sir?” rejoined the guard, touching his hat. “Man or woman,
 pray, sir?”
 
 “A woman,” replied the gentleman. “It is supposed—”
 
 “Now, Ben,” replied the coachman impatiently.
 
 “Damn that ’ere bag,” said the guard; “are you gone to sleep in there?”
 
 “Coming!” cried the office keeper, running out.
 
 “Coming,” growled the guard. “Ah, and so’s the young ’ooman of property
 that’s going to take a fancy to me, but I don’t know when. Here, give
 hold. All ri—ight!”
 
 The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.
 
 Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he
 had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where
 to go. At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from
 Hatfield to St. Albans.
 
 He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged
 into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe
 creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him,
 substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some
 fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that
 haunted him of that morning’s ghastly figure following at his heels. He
 could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the
 outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along. He
 could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of
 wind came laden with that last low cry. If he stopped it did the same.
 If he ran, it followed—not running too: that would have been a relief:
 but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on
 one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.
 
 At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat
 this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on
 his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was
 behind him then. He had kept it before him that morning, but it was
 behind now—always. He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it
 stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky. He threw
 himself upon the road—on his back upon the road. At his head it stood,
 silent, erect, and still—a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in
 blood.
 
 Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence
 must sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long
 minute of that agony of fear.
 
 There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the
 night. Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it
 very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.
 He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched
 himself close to the wall—to undergo new torture.
 
 For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than
 that from which he had escaped. Those widely staring eyes, so
 lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than
 think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in
 themselves, but giving light to nothing. There were but two, but they
 were everywhere. If he shut out the sight, there came the room with
 every well-known object—some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if
 he had gone over its contents from memory—each in its accustomed place.
 The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he
 stole away. He got up, and rushed into the field without. The figure
 was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more. The
 eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.
 
 And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling
 in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when
 suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting,
 and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder. Any sound of men in
 that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was
 something to him. He regained his strength and energy at the prospect
 of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open
 air.
 
 The broad sky seemed on fire. Rising into the air with showers of
 sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting
 the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the
 direction where he stood. The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled
 the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing
 of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames
 as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though
 refreshed by food. The noise increased as he looked. There were people
 there—men and women—light, bustle. It was like new life to him. He
 darted onward—straight, headlong—dashing through brier and brake, and
 leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and
 sounding bark before him.
 
 He came upon the spot. There were half-dressed figures tearing to and
 fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables,
 others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others
 coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks,
 and the tumbling down of red-hot beams. The apertures, where doors and
 windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls
 rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron
 poured down, white hot, upon the ground. Women and children shrieked,
 and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers. The
 clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water
 as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar. He
 shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself,
 plunged into the thickest of the throng. Hither and thither he dived
 that night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the
 smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and
 men were thickest. Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of
 buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under
 the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire
 was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise,
 nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke
 and blackened ruins remained.
 
 This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the
 dreadful consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him,
 for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject
 of their talk. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and
 they drew off, stealthily, together. He passed near an engine where
 some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their
 refreshment. He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of
 beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the
 murder. “He has gone to Birmingham, they say,” said one: “but they’ll
 have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there’ll
 be a cry all through the country.”
 
 He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then
 lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. He
 wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the
 fear of another solitary night.
 
 Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.
 
 “There’s somebody to speak to there, at all event,” he thought. “A good
 hiding-place, too. They’ll never expect to nab me there, after this
 country scent. Why can’t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt
 from Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I’ll risk it.”
 
 He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least
 frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed
 within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by
 a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had
 fixed on for his destination.
 
 The dog, though. If any description of him were out, it would not be
 forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him.
 This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets. He
 resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking
 up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.
 
 The animal looked up into his master’s face while these preparations
 were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their
 purpose, or the robber’s sidelong look at him was sterner than
 ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and
 cowered as he came more slowly along. When his master halted at the
 brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.
 
 “Do you hear me call? Come here!” cried Sikes.
 
 The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped
 to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and
 started back.
 
 “Come back!” said the robber.
 
 The dog wagged his tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and
 called him again.
 
 The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his
 hardest speed.
 
 The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the
 expectation that he would return. But no dog appeared, and at length he
 resumed his journey.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER XLIX.
 MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE
 INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT
 
 
 The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from
 a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly. The door being
 opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one
 side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box,
 dismounted too, and stood upon the other side. At a sign from Mr.
 Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them,
 hurried him into the house. This man was Monks.
 
 They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.
 Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of
 this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance,
 stopped. The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for
 instructions.
 
 “He knows the alternative,” said Mr. Browlow. “If he hesitates or moves
 a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid
 of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.”
 
 “How dare you say this of me?” asked Monks.
 
 “How dare you urge me to it, young man?” replied Mr. Brownlow,
 confronting him with a steady look. “Are you mad enough to leave this
 house? Unhand him. There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow.
 But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant
 will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery. I am
 resolute and immoveable. If you are determined to be the same, your
 blood be upon your own head!”
 
 “By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by
 these dogs?” asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who
 stood beside him.
 
 “By mine,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “Those persons are indemnified by me.
 If you complain of being deprived of your liberty—you had power and
 opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it
 advisable to remain quiet—I say again, throw yourself for protection on
 the law. I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far
 to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have
 passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf
 into which you rushed, yourself.”
 
 Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. He hesitated.
 
 “You will decide quickly,” said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and
 composure. “If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign
 you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a
 shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the
 way. If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those
 you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair.
 It has waited for you two whole days.”
 
 Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.
 
 “You will be prompt,” said Mr. Brownlow. “A word from me, and the
 alternative has gone for ever.”
 
 Still the man hesitated.
 
 “I have not the inclination to parley,” said Mr. Brownlow, “and, as I
 advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.”
 
 “Is there—” demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,—“is there—no middle
 course?”
 
 “None.”
 
 Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in
 his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the
 room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.
 
 “Lock the door on the outside,” said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants,
 “and come when I ring.”
 
 The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.
 
 “This is pretty treatment, sir,” said Monks, throwing down his hat and
 cloak, “from my father’s oldest friend.”
 
 “It is because I was your father’s oldest friend, young man,” returned
 Mr. Brownlow; “it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy
 years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and
 kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary,
 lonely man: it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters’s
 death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would—but Heaven
 willed otherwise—have made her my young wife; it is because my seared
 heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and
 errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations
 filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts
 of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you
 gently now—yes, Edward Leeford, even now—and blush for your
 unworthiness who bear the name.”
 
 “What has the name to do with it?” asked the other, after
 contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the
 agitation of his companion. “What is the name to me?”
 
 “Nothing,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “nothing to you. But it was _hers_,
 and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the
 glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a
 stranger. I am very glad you have changed it—very—very.”
 
 “This is all mighty fine,” said Monks (to retain his assumed
 designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself
 in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his
 face with his hand. “But what do you want with me?”
 
 “You have a brother,” said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: “a brother,
 the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the
 street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither,
 in wonder and alarm.”
 
 “I have no brother,” replied Monks. “You know I was an only child. Why
 do you talk to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.”
 
 “Attend to what I do know, and you may not,” said Mr. Brownlow. “I
 shall interest you by and by. I know that of the wretched marriage,
 into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all
 ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole
 and most unnatural issue.”
 
 “I don’t care for hard names,” interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.
 “You know the fact, and that’s enough for me.”
 
 “But I also know,” pursued the old gentleman, “the misery, the slow
 torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how
 listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their
 heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both. I know how
 cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave
 place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last
 they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space
 apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death
 could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest
 looks they could assume. Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon. But
 it rusted and cankered at your father’s heart for years.”
 
 “Well, they were separated,” said Monks, “and what of that?”
 
 “When they had been separated for some time,” returned Mr. Brownlow,
 “and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had
 utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who,
 with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new
 friends. This circumstance, at least, you know already.”
 
 “Not I,” said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon
 the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. “Not I.”
 
 “Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never
 forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,” returned Mr.
 Brownlow. “I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than
 eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty—for he was, I
 repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry. Must I go back
 to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will
 you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?”
 
 “I have nothing to disclose,” rejoined Monks. “You must talk on if you
 will.”
 
 “These new friends, then,” said Mr. Brownlow, “were a naval officer
 retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year
 before, and left him with two children—there had been more, but, of all
 their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters; one a
 beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or
 three years old.”
 
 “What’s this to me?” asked Monks.
 
 “They resided,” said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the
 interruption, “in a part of the country to which your father in his
 wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.
 Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your
 father was gifted as few men are. He had his sister’s soul and person.
 As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him. I would
 that it had ended there. His daughter did the same.”
 
 The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes
 fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:
 
 “The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that
 daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a
 guileless girl.”
 
 “Your tale is of the longest,” observed Monks, moving restlessly in his
 chair.
 
 “It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,” returned
 Mr. Brownlow, “and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed
 joy and happiness, it would be very brief. At length one of those rich
 relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had
 been sacrificed, as others are often—it is no uncommon case—died, and
 to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him
 his panacea for all griefs—Money. It was necessary that he should
 immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and
 where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion. He went; was
 seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the
 intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he
 died the day after her arrival, leaving no will—_no will_—so that the
 whole property fell to her and you.”
 
 At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a
 face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards
 the speaker. As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the
 air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face
 and hands.
 
 “Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,”
 said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other’s face,
 “he came to me.”
 
 “I never heard of that,” interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear
 incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.
 
 “He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture—a
 portrait painted by himself—a likeness of this poor girl—which he did
 not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty
 journey. He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked
 in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself;
 confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any
 loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of
 his recent acquisition, to fly the country—I guessed too well he would
 not fly alone—and never see it more. Even from me, his old and early
 friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that
 covered one most dear to both—even from me he withheld any more
 particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after
 that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. Alas! _That_ was
 the last time. I had no letter, and I never saw him more.”
 
 “I went,” said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, “I went, when all was
 over, to the scene of his—I will use the term the world would freely
 use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him—of his guilty
 love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should
 find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her. The family
 had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling
 debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by
 night. Why, or whither, none can tell.”
 
 Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of
 triumph.
 
 “When your brother,” said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other’s
 chair, “When your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected child: was cast
 in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life
 of vice and infamy—”
 
 “What?” cried Monks.
 
 “By me,” said Mr. Brownlow. “I told you I should interest you before
 long. I say by me—I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name,
 although for aught he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears.
 When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my
 house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck
 me with astonishment. Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and
 misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me
 like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream. I
 need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history—”
 
 “Why not?” asked Monks hastily.
 
 “Because you know it well.”
 
 “I!”
 
 “Denial to me is vain,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “I shall show you that I
 know more than that.”
 
 “You—you—can’t prove anything against me,” stammered Monks. “I defy you
 to do it!”
 
 “We shall see,” returned the old gentleman with a searching glance. “I
 lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him. Your mother
 being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody
 could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate
 in the West Indies—whither, as you well know, you retired upon your
 mother’s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here—I
 made the voyage. You had left it, months before, and were supposed to
 be in London, but no one could tell where. I returned. Your agents had
 no clue to your residence. You came and went, they said, as strangely
 as you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for
 months: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with
 the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce
 ungovernable boy. I wearied them with new applications. I paced the
 streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were
 fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.”
 
 “And now you do see me,” said Monks, rising boldly, “what then? Fraud
 and robbery are high-sounding words—justified, you think, by a fancied
 resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man’s Brother!
 You don’t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you
 don’t even know that.”
 
 “I _did not_,” replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; “but within the last
 fortnight I have learnt it all. You have a brother; you know it, and
 him. There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret
 and the gain to you at her own death. It contained a reference to some
 child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was
 born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were
 first awakened by his resemblance to your father. You repaired to the
 place of his birth. There existed proofs—proofs long suppressed—of his
 birth and parentage. Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in
 your own words to your accomplice the Jew, ‘_the only proofs of the
 boy’s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that
 received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.’ Unworthy son,
 coward, liar,—you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in
 dark rooms at night,—you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent
 death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,—you, who from
 your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father’s heart, and in
 whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found
 a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to
 your mind—you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!”
 
 “No, no, no!” returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated
 charges.
 
 “Every word!” cried the gentleman, “every word that has passed between
 you and this detested villain, is known to me. Shadows on the wall have
 caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the
 persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and
 almost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you
 were morally if not really a party.”
 
 “No, no,” interposed Monks. “I—I knew nothing of that; I was going to
 inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me. I didn’t know the
 cause. I thought it was a common quarrel.”
 
 “It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,” replied Mr. Brownlow.
 “Will you disclose the whole?”
 
 “Yes, I will.”
 
 “Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before
 witnesses?”
 
 “That I promise too.”
 
 “Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed
 with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose
 of attesting it?”
 
 “If you insist upon that, I’ll do that also,” replied Monks.
 
 “You must do more than that,” said Mr. Brownlow. “Make restitution to
 an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the
 offspring of a guilty and most miserable love. You have not forgotten
 the provisions of the will. Carry them into execution so far as your
 brother is concerned, and then go where you please. In this world you
 need meet no more.”
 
 While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks
 on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears
 on the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly
 unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent
 agitation.
 
 “The man will be taken,” he cried. “He will be taken to-night!”
 
 “The murderer?” asked Mr. Brownlow.
 
 “Yes, yes,” replied the other. “His dog has been seen lurking about
 some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is,
 or will be, there, under cover of the darkness. Spies are hovering
 about in every direction. I have spoken to the men who are charged with
 his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape. A reward of a hundred
 pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.”
 
 “I will give fifty more,” said Mr. Brownlow, “and proclaim it with my
 own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it. Where is Mr. Maylie?”
 
 “Harry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with
 you, he hurried off to where he heard this,” replied the doctor, “and
 mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place
 in the outskirts agreed upon between them.”
",OliverTwist
53," Then she weakened, changed. “Gabriel, don’t be so hard, so unlike
 yourself. I don’t know what has come over you.”
 
 He put his arms about her and spoke hoarsely:
 
 “My darling, my more than treasure. I can’t doubt you, and yet I am
 riven with doubt. Forgive me, but how can you forgive me if I am wrong?
 Tell me again, tell me once and for always that nothing has been going
 on of which I have been kept in ignorance, that you would not, could not
 have broken your word to me. You look ill, scared.... I know now that
 from the moment I came you have not been yourself, your beautiful candid
 self. Margaret, crown of my life, sweetheart; darling, speak, tell me.
 Is there anything I ought to know?” He spoke with ineffable tenderness.
 
 He was bending over her, holding her, her heart beat against his heart;
 she would have answered had she been able. But when her words came they
 were no answer to his.
 
 “Darling, how strange you are! There is certainly nothing you ought to
 know. Let me go and get my things off. How strange that you should doubt
 me, that you should rather believe that dreadful woman. I have never
 seen her since you were down here last, nor heard from her....”
 
 Her cheeks flamed and were hidden against his coat, she hated her own
 disingenuousness. It had been difficult to tell him, now it was
 impossible. “Let me go.”
 
 He released her and she went over to the looking-glass, adjusted her
 veil. She had burnt her boats, now there was nothing for it but denial
 and more denial. Thoughts went in and out of her aching head like forked
 lightning. _He would never know. Peter would arrange, Peter would
 manage._ It was a dreadful thing she had done, dreadful. But she had
 been driven to it. If the time would come over again ... but time never
 does come over again. She must play her part and play it boldly. She was
 trembling inside, but outwardly he saw her preening herself before the
 glass as she talked to him.
 
 “I think we have had enough of Mrs. Roope. You haven’t half admired my
 frock. I have a great mind not to wear my new teagown tonight. I should
 resent it being ignored. We ought to go out again until dinner, the
 afternoon is lovely. I can’t sit on the beach in this, but I need only
 slip on an old skirt. Shall I put on another skirt? Do you feel in the
 humour for the beach? I’ve a thousand questions to ask you. I seem to
 have been down here by myself for an age. I have actually started a
 book! What do you say to that? I want to tell you about it. What has
 been decided about the door-plates? What did the parents say when they
 heard I’d fled?”
 
 “I didn’t see them until the next day.”
 
 “Had they recovered?”
 
 “They were resigned. I promised to bring you back with me on Monday.”
 
 “And now you don’t want to?”
 
 “How can you say that?”
 
 “Did I say it? My mood is frivolous, you mustn’t take me too seriously.
 The beach ... you haven’t answered about the beach. Perhaps you’d rather
 walk. I don’t mind adventuring this skirt if we walk.”
 
 “You are not too tired?”
 
 “How conventional!”
 
 Something had come between them, some summer cloud or thunderstorm. Try
 as they would during the remainder of the day they could not break
 through or see each other as clearly as before. Margaret talked
 frivolously, or seriously, rallied, jested with him. He struggled to
 keep up with her, to take his tone from hers, to be natural. But both of
 them were acutely aware of failure, of artificiality. The walk, the
 dinner, the short evening failed to better the situation. When they bade
 each other good-night he made one more effort.
 
 “You find it impossible to forgive me?”
 
 “There is nothing I would not forgive you. That’s the essential
 difference between us,” she answered lightly.
 
 “There is no essential difference; don’t say it.”
 
 “The day has been something of a failure, don’t you think? But then so
 was the day when you cut yourself shaving.” She maintained the flippant
 tone. “That came right. Perhaps tomorrow when we meet we shall find each
 other wholly adorable again.” She would not be serious, was light,
 frivolous to the last. “Good-night. Don’t paint devils, don’t see
 ghosts. Tomorrow everything may be as before. Kiss me good-night. Sleep
 well!” He kissed her, hesitated, kept her in the shelter of his arms:
 
 “Margaret....” She freed herself:
 
 “No. I know that tone. It means more questions. You ought to have lived
 in the time of the Spanish Inquisition. Don’t you wish you could put me
 on the rack? There _is_ a touch of the inquisitor about you. I never
 noticed it before.... Good-night!”
 
 
 
 
                                CHAPTER XV
 
 
 Margaret slept ill that night. Round and round in her unhappy mind
 swirled the irrefutable fact that she had lied to her lover, and that he
 knew she had lied. Broken her promise, her oath; and he knew that she
 was forsworn. She passionately desired his respect; in all things he had
 been on his knees before her. If he were no longer there she would find
 the change of attitude difficult to endure. Yet in the watches of the
 night she clung to the hope that he could know nothing definitely. He
 might suspect or divine, but he could not know. She counted on Peter
 Kennedy, trusted that when the five hundred pounds were paid the woman
 would be satisfied, would go quietly away, that nothing more would ever
 be heard of her.
 
 Wednesday next they were to be married. She told herself that if she had
 lost anything she would regain it then. Perhaps she would tell him, but
 not until after she had re-won him. She knew her power. If, too, she
 distrusted it, sensing something in him incorruptible and granite-hard,
 she took faint and feverish consolation by reminding herself that it was
 night-time, when all troubles look their worst. She resolutely refused
 to consider the permanent loss of that which she now knew she valued
 more than life itself. The possibility intruded, but she would not look.
 
 In short snatches of troubled sleep she lived again through the scenes
 of the afternoon, saw him doubt, heard him question, gave flippant
 answers. In oases of wakefulness she felt his arms about her, and the
 restrained kisses that were like vows; conjured up thrilled moments when
 she knew how well he loved her. She began to dread those nightmare
 sleeps, and to force herself to keep awake. At four o’clock she consoled
 herself that it would soon be daylight. At five o’clock, after a
 desperate short nightmare of estrangement from which she awoke,
 quick-pulsed and pallid, she got up and put on a dressing-gown, drew up
 the blind, and opened wide the window. She watched the slow dawn and in
 the darkness heard the breakers on the stony beach. Nature calmed and
 quieted her. She began to think her fears had been foolish, to believe
 that she had not only played for safety but secured it, that the coming
 day would bring her the Gabriel she knew best, the humble and adoring
 lover. She pictured their coming together, his dear smile and restored
 confidence. He would have forgotten yesterday. The dawn she was watching
 illumined and lightened the sky. Soon the sun would rise grandly,
 already his place was roseate-hued. “Red sky in the morning is the
 shepherd’s warning,” runs the old proverb. But Margaret had never heard,
 or had forgotten it. To her the roseate dawn was all promise. The day
 before them should be exquisite as yesterday, and weld them with its
 warmth. She would withhold nothing from him, nothing of her love. Then
 peace would fall between them? and the renewal of love? At six o’clock
 she pulled down the blinds and went back to bed again, where for two
 hours she slept dreamlessly. Stevens woke her with the inevitable tea.
 
 “It can’t be morning yet? It is hardly light.” She struggled with her
 drowsiness. “I don’t hear rain, do I?”
 
 “There’s no saying what you hear, but it’s raining sure enough, a
 miserable morning for May.”
 
 “May! But it is nearly June!”
 
 “I’m not gainsaying the calendar.”
 
 “Pull up the blind.”
 
 A short time before she had gazed on a roseate dawn, now rain was
 driving pitilessly across the landscape, and all the sky was grey. No
 longer could she hear the breakers on the shore. All she heard was the
 rain. Stevens shut the window.
 
 “You’d best not be getting up early. There’s nothing to get up for on a
 morning like this. It’s not as if you was in the habit of going to
 church.” Margaret was conscious of depression. Stevens’s grumbling kept
 it at bay, and she detained her on one excuse or another; tried to
 extract humour from her habitual dissatisfaction.
 
 “It will be like this all day, you see if it isn’t. The rain is coming
 down straight, too, and the smoke’s blowing all ways.” She changed the
 subject abruptly, as maids will, intent on her duties. “I’ll have to be
 getting out your clothes. What do you think you’ll wear?”
 
 “I meant to try my new whipcord.”
 
 “With the wheat-ear hat! What’s the good of that if you won’t have a
 chance of going out?”
 
 “One of my new tea-gowns, then?”
 
 “I never did hold with tea-gowns in the morning,” Stevens answered
 lugubriously. “I suppose Mr. Stanton will be coming over. Not but what
 he’ll get wet through.”
 
 “I shouldn’t be surprised if he came all the same.” Margaret smiled, and
 the omniscient maid reflected the smile, if a little sourly.
 
 “There’s never no saying. There’s that telephone going. Another mistake,
 I suppose. I wish I’d the drilling of them girls. Oh! I’m coming, I’m
 coming!” she cried out to the insensitive instrument. “Don’t you attempt
 to get up till I come back. You’re going to have a fire to dress by;
 calendar or no calendar, it’s as cold as winter.”
 
 Margaret watched the rain driving in wind gusts against the window until
 Stevens came back. Somehow the rain seemed to have altered everything,
 she felt the fatigue of her broken night, the irritability of her frayed
 nerves.
 
 “It’s that there Dr. Kennedy. He wants to know how soon he may come
 over. He says he’s got something to tell you. ‘All the fat’s in the
 fire,’ he said. ‘Am I to tell her that?’ I arst him. ‘Tell her anything
 you like,’ he answered, ‘but find out how soon I can see her.’ Very
 arbitrary he was and impatient, as if I’d nothing to do but give and
 take his messages.”
 
 “Tell him I’m just getting up. I can be ready in half an hour.”
 
 “I shall tell him nothing of the sort. Half an hour, indeed, with your
 bath and everything, and no breakfast, and the fire not yet lit. Nor one
 of the rooms done, I shouldn’t think....”
 
 “Tell him I’ll see him in half an hour,” Margaret persisted. “Now go
 away, that’s a good woman, and do as you are told. Don’t stand there
 arguing, or I’ll answer the telephone myself.” She put one foot out of
 bed as if to be as good as her word, and Stevens, grumbling and
 astonished, went to do her bidding.
 
 Half an hour seemed too long for Margaret. What had Peter Kennedy to
 tell her? Had he met or seen Mrs. Roope? “All the fat was in the fire.”
 What fat, what fire? The phrase foreshadowed comedy and not tragedy. But
 that was nothing for Peter Kennedy, who was in continual need of
 editing, who had not the gift of expression nor the capacity of
 appropriate words. She scrambled in and out of her bath, to Stevens’s
 indignation, never waiting for the room to be warmed. She was impatient
 about her hair, would not sit still to have it properly brushed, but
 took the long strands in her own hands and “twisted them up anyhow.”
 Stevens’s description of the whole toilette would have been sorry
 reading in a dress magazine or ladies’ paper.
 
 “Give me anything,” she says, “anything. What does it matter? He’ll be
 here any minute now. The old dressing-gown, or a shirt and skirt.
 Whichever is quickest. What a slowcoach you’re getting!”
 
 “Slowcoach! She called me a slowcoach, and from first to last it hadn’t
 been twenty minutes.”
 
 Margaret, sufficiently dressed, but without having breakfasted, very
 pale and impatient, was at the window of the music room when Peter came
 up the gravel path in his noisy motor, flung in the clutch with a
 grating sound, pulled the machine to a standstill. There was no ceremony
 about showing him up. He was in the room before she had collected
 herself. He, too, was pale, his chin unshaved, his eyes a little wild;
 looking as if he, also, had not slept.
 
 “You’ve heard what happened?” he began, abruptly.... “No, of course you
 haven’t, how could you? What a fool I am! There’s been a hell of a
 hullabaloo. That’s why I telephoned, rushed up. You know that she-cat
 came down here?” He had difficulty in explaining his errand.
 
 “Yes. I saw her, she waited for you at the hotel. Go on, what next?”
 
 “I didn’t get back until after nine o’clock. And then I found her
 waiting for me. The servants did not know what to make of her; they told
 me they couldn’t understand what she said, so I suppose she talked
 Christian Science. Fortunately I’d got the cheque with me. I had not
 been able to change it, the London banks were all closed. She took it
 like a bird. Not without some of the jargon and hope that I’d mend my
 ways, give up prescribing drugs. You know the sort of thing. I thought
 I’d got through, that it was all over. The cheque was dated Saturday,
 she would be able to cash it first thing Monday morning. It was as good
 as money directly the banks opened. I never dreamt of them meeting.”
 
 “Who?” asked Margaret, with pale lips. She knew well enough, although
 she asked and waited for an answer.
 
 “She and Gabriel Stanton. It seems she was too late for the last train
 and had to put up at the hotel....”
 
 “At the King’s Arms?”
 
 “Yes. He met her there, or rather she forced herself on him. God knows
 what she had in her mind. Pure mischief, I suspect, though of course it
 may have been propaganda. It seems he came in about ten o’clock and went
 on to the terrace to smoke or to look at the sea. She followed him
 there, tackled him about his sister or his soul.”
 
 “How do you know all this?”
 
 “Let me tell the story my own way. He met her full-face so to speak,
 wanted to know exactly what she was doing in this part of the world.
 Perhaps she didn’t know she was giving away the show. Perhaps she didn’t
 know he wasn’t exactly in our confidence. There is no use thinking the
 worst of her.”
 
 “She knew what she was doing, that she was coming between us.” Margaret
 spoke in a low voice, a voice of desperate certainty and hopelessness.
 
 “Well, that doesn’t matter one way or another, what her intentions were,
 I mean. I don’t know myself what had happened between you and him.
 Although of course I spotted quick enough he’d had some sort of
 shock....”
 
 “Then you have seen him!”
 
 “I was coming to that. After his interview with her he came straight to
 me.”
 
 “To you! But it was already night!”
 
 “I’d gone to bed, but he rang the night bell, rang and rang again. I
 didn’t know who it was when I shouted through the tube that I’d come
 down, that I shouldn’t be half a minute. When I let him in I thought he
 was a ghost. I was quite staggered, he seemed all frozen up, stiff. Just
 for a moment it flashed across me that he’d come from you, that you were
 ill, needed me. But he did not give me time to say the wrong things.
 ‘Mrs. Roope has just left me,’ he began. ‘The devil she has,’ was all I
 could find to answer. I was quite taken aback. I needn’t go over it all
 word by word, it wasn’t very pleasant. He accused me of compromising
 you, seemed to think I’d done it on purpose, had some nefarious motive.
 I was in the dark about how much he knew, and that handicapped me. I
 swore you knew nothing about it, and he said haughtily that I was to
 leave your name out of the conversation. And now I’m coming to the
 point. Why I am here at all. It seems she tried to rush him for a bit
 more, and he, well practically told her to go to blazes, said he should
 stop the cheque, prosecute her. He seemed to think I was trying to save
 myself at your expense. ASS! He is going up this morning to see his
 lawyer, he wants an information laid at Scotland Yard. He says the
 Christian Science people are practically living on blackmail, getting
 hold of family secrets or skeletons. And he’s not going to stand for it.
 I did all I knew to persuade him to let well alone. We nearly came to
 blows, only he was so damned dignified. I said I believed it would break
 you up if there was another scandal. ‘I have no doubt that Mrs. Capel
 will see the matter in the same light that I do,’ he said in the
 stiffest of all his stiff ways.” Peter Kennedy paused. He had another
 word to say, but he said it awkwardly, with an immense effort, and after
 a pause.
 
 “He’ll come up here this morning and tackle you. You don’t care a curse
 if I’m dead or alive, I know that. But if ... if he drives you too
 far ... well, you know I’d lay down my life for you. He says I’ve no
 principle, and as far as you’re concerned that’s true enough. I’d say
 black was white, I’d steal or starve to give you pleasure, save you
 pain. That’s what I’ve come to say, to put myself at your service.” She
 put up her hand, motioned him to silence. All this time he had been
 standing up, now he flung himself into a chair, brushed his hand across
 his forehead. “I hardly know what I’m saying, I haven’t slept a wink.”
 
 “You were saying you would do anything for me.”
 
 “I meant that right enough.”
 
 Without any preparation, for until now she had listened apparently
 calmly, she broke into a sudden storm of tears. He got up again and went
 and stood beside her.
 
 “I can’t live without him,” she said. “I can’t live without him,” she
 repeated weakly.
 
 “Oh, I say, you know....” But he had nothing to say. The sniffing
 Stevens, disapproval strongly marked upon her countenance, here brought
 in a tray with coffee and rolls. Margaret, recovering herself with an
 effort, motioned her to set it down.
 
 “You ought to make her take it,” Stevens said to Dr. Kennedy
 indignantly, “disturbing her before she’s breakfasted. She’s had nothing
 inside her lips.” He was glad of the interruption.
 
 “You stay and back me up, then.” Together they persuaded or forced her
 to the coffee, she could not eat, and was impatient that Stevens and the
 tray should go away. Her outburst was over, but she was pitiably shaken.
 
 “He’ll come round, all right,” Peter said awkwardly, when they were
 alone again. She looked at him with fear in her eyes:
 
 “Do you really think so?”
 
 “Who wouldn’t?”
 
 “You don’t think he would go up to London without seeing me?”
 
 “Not likely.”
 
 She spoke again presently. In the interval Peter conjured up the image
 of Gabriel Stanton, speaking to her as he had to him, refusing
 compromise, harshly unapproachable, rigid.
 
 “I could never go through what I went through before.”
 
 “You shan’t.”
 
 “What could you do?”
 
 “I’ll find some way ... a medical certificate!”
 
 “The shame of it!” She covered her face with her hands.
 
 “It won’t happen. She’s had her money. He may have rubbed her up the
 wrong way, but after all she has nothing to gain by interfering.”
 
 “If only I had told him myself! If only I hadn’t lied to him!”
 
 Peter, desperately miserable, walked about the room, interjecting a word
 now and again, trying to inspirit her.
 
 “You had better go,” she said to him in the end. “It’s nearly ten
 o’clock. If he is coming up at all he will be here soon.”
 
 “Of course he is coming up. How can I leave you like this?” he answered
 wildly. “Can’t I do anything, say anything, see him for you?” Margaret
 showed the pale simulacrum of a smile.
 
 “That was my idea, once before, wasn’t it? No, you can’t see him for
 me.”
 
 “I can’t do anything?”
 
 “I’m not sure.”
 
 She spoke slowly, hesitatingly. In truth she did not know how she was to
 bear what she saw before her. Not marriage, safety, happiness, was to be
 hers, only humiliation. Death was preferable, a thousand times
 preferable. She was impulsive and leaped to this conclusion.
 
 “Can’t I do anything?” he said again.
 
 “Peter, Peter Kennedy, you say you would do anything, anything, for me.
 I wonder what you mean by it.... How much or how little?”
 
 “Lay down my life.”
 
 “Or risk it? There must be a way, you must know a way of ... of
 shortening things. I could not go through it all again ... not now. If
 the worst came to the worst, if I can’t make him listen to reason, if he
 won’t forgive or understand. If I have to face the court again, my
 father and stepmother to know of my ... my imprudence, all the horrors
 to be repeated. To have to stand up and deny ... be cross-examined.
 About you as well as him....”
 
 Again she hid her face. Then, after a pause in which she saw her life
 befouled, and Gabriel Stanton as her judge or executioner, she lifted a
 strained and desperate face. “You would find a way to end it?”
 
 She waited for his answer.
 
 “I don’t know what you mean.”
 
 “Yes, you do. If it became unbearable. Life no longer a gift, but
 leprous....”
 
 “It isn’t as if you had done anything,” he exclaimed.
 
 “I’ve promised and broken my promise, lied, deceived him. It was only to
 secure his happiness, mine ... ours.... But if he takes it differently,
 and must have publicity....”
 
 “I don’t believe you could go through it,” he said gloomily. “One of
 those heart attacks of yours might come on.”
 
 “You know the pain is intolerable.”
 
 “That amyl helps you.”
 
 “Not much.”
 
 “Morphia.”
 
 “Was a failure last time. Peter, _think_, won’t you think? Couldn’t you
 give me anything? Isn’t there any drug? You are fond of drugs, learned
 in them. Isn’t there any drug that would put me out of my misery?”
 
 He listened and she pressed him.
 
 “Think, _think_.”
 
 “Of course there are drugs.”
 
 “But _the_ drug.”
 
 “There’s hyoscine....”
 
 “Tell me the effect of that?”
 
 “It depends how it is given ... what it is given for.”
 
 “For forgetfulness?”
 
 “A quarter of a grain injection.”
 
 “And, and....”
 
 “Nothing, nothingness.”
 
 “If you love me, Peter.... You say you love me.... If the worst came to
 the worst, you will help me through...?”
 
 “Don’t.”
 
 “I must.... I want your promise.”
 
 “What is the good of promising? I couldn’t do it.”
 
 “You said you could die for me.”
 
 “It isn’t my death you are asking. Unless I should be hanged!”
 
 “You can safeguard yourself.”
 
 “You will never ask me.”
 
 “But if I did?”
 
 “Oh, God knows!”
 
 “If I not only asked but implored? Give me this hope, this promise. _If_
 I come to the end of my tether, can bear no more; then ask you for
 release, the great release...?”
 
 “My hand would drop off.”
 
 “Lose your hand.”
 
 “My heart would fail.”
",Twilight
54," shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”
 
 The “Black Swan” is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no
 distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting
 for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon
 the table.
 
 “I am so delighted that you have come,” she said, earnestly. “It is so
 very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your
 advice will be altogether invaluable to me.”
 
 “Pray tell us what has happened to you.”
 
 “I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to
 be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,
 though he little knew for what purpose.”
 
 “Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin
 legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
 
 “In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no
 actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to
 them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my
 mind about them.”
 
 “What can you not understand?”
 
 “Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as
 it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here, and drove me
 in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully
 situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square
 block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp
 and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and
 on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high-road,
 which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This
 ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part
 of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately
 in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
 
 [Illustration: “‘I AM SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME’”]
 
 “I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was
 introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no
 truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable
 in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her
 to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not
 more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than
 forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been
 married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only
 child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.
 Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
 was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her step-mother. As the
 daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that
 her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.
 
 “Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colorless in mind as well as in
 feature. She impressed me neither favorably nor the reverse. She was a
 nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both
 to her husband and to her little son. Her light gray eyes wandered
 continually from one to the other, noting every little want and
 forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,
 boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.
 And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost
 in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I
 have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the
 disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never
 met so utterly spoilt and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small
 for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His
 whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of
 passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature
 weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he
 shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little
 birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr.
 Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”
 
 “I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to
 you to be relevant or not.”
 
 “I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant
 thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance
 and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.
 Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled
 hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have
 been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to
 take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a
 sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle, and much less amiable. They are
 a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in
 the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner
 of the building.
 
 “For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very
 quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and
 whispered something to her husband.
 
 “‘Oh yes,’ said he, turning to me; ‘we are very much obliged to you,
 Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.
 I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your
 appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become
 you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you
 would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’
 
 “The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of
 blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore
 unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been
 a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
 expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated
 in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which
 is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,
 with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been
 placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In
 this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on
 the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest
 stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he
 was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who
 has evidently no sense of humor, never so much as smiled, but sat with
 her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an
 hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence
 the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to
 little Edward in the nursery.
 
 “Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly
 similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the
 window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which
 my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.
 Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and, moving my chair a little
 sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me
 to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the
 heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he
 ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
 
 “You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what
 the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They
 were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the
 window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going
 on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon
 devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought
 seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On
 the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief
 up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that
 there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was
 nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,
 however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton
 Road, a small bearded man in a gray suit, who seemed to be looking in
 my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually
 people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings
 which bordered our field, and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my
 handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle, to find her eyes fixed upon
 me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced
 that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand, and had seen what
 was behind me. She rose at once.
 
 “‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road
 there who stares up at Miss Hunter.’
 
 “‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.
 
 “‘No; I know no one in these parts.’
 
 “‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to
 go away.’
 
 “‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’
 
 “‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round
 and wave him away like that.’
 
 “I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down
 the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again
 in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the
 road.”
 
 “Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most
 interesting one.”
 
 “You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to
 be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.
 On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle
 took me to a small out-house which stands near the kitchen door. As we
 approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as
 of a large animal moving about.
 
 “‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two
 planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’
 
 “I looked through, and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a
 vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
 
 “‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I
 had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really
 old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We
 feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as
 keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the
 trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you
 ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it
 is as much as your life is worth.’
 
 “The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look
 out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a
 beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was
 silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in
 the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was
 moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the
 moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,
 tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting
 bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow
 upon the other side. That dreadful silent sentinel sent a chill to my
 heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.
 
 “And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you
 know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil
 at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed,
 I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by
 rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers
 in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.
 I had filled the first two with my linen, and, as I had still much
 to pack away, I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the
 third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere
 oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The
 very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There
 was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what
 it was. It was my coil of hair.
 
 “I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and
 the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded
 itself upon me. How _could_ my hair have been locked in the drawer?
 With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and
 drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and
 I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle
 as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned
 the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the
 Rucastles, as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a
 drawer which they had locked.
 
 “I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I
 soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was
 one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door
 which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened
 into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I
 ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,
 his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very
 different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His
 cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins
 stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried
 past me without a word or a look.
 
 “This aroused my curiosity; so when I went out for a walk in the
 grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could
 see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a
 row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered
 up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,
 glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as
 merry and jovial as ever.
 
 “‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a
 word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’
 
 “I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By-the-way,’ said I, ‘you
 seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has
 the shutters up.’
 
 “He looked surprised, and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my
 remark.
 
 “‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room
 up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.
 Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke
 in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at
 me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
 
 “Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was
 something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all
 on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my
 share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good
 might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s
 instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.
 At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any
 chance to pass the forbidden door.
 
 “It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
 besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in
 these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen
 bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and
 yesterday evening he was very drunk; and, when I came up-stairs, there
 was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it
 there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both down-stairs, and the child was
 with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key
 gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.
 
 “There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,
 which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner
 were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.
 They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows
 in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening
 light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and
 across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of
 an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened
 at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and
 the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with
 the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
 beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a
 skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage
 gazing at the sinister door, and wondering what secret it might veil,
 I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room, and saw a shadow
 pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which
 shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in
 me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly,
 and I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me
 clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through
 the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
 outside.
 
 “‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be
 when I saw the door open.’
 
 “‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.
 
 “‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how
 caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my
 dear young lady?’
 
 “But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was
 keenly on my guard against him.
 
 “‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it
 is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran
 out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’
 
 “‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.
 
 “‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.
 
 “‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’
 
 “‘I am sure that I do not know.’
 
 “‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He
 was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
 
 “‘I am sure if I had known—’
 
 “‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that
 threshold again—’ here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of
 rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw
 you to the mastiff.’
 
 “I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I
 must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I
 found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,
 Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was
 frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,
 even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring
 you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,
 but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon
 made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down
 to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
 returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind
 as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered
 that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that
 evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had
 any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him
 free. I slipped in in safety, and lay awake half the night in my joy at
 the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come
 into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,
 for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all
 the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
 all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could
 tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”
 
 Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My
 friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his
 pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.
 
 “Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.
 
 “Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing
 with him.”
 
 “That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”
 
 “Yes, the wine-cellar.”
 
 “You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave
 and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one
 more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite
 exceptional woman.”
 
 “I will try. What is it?”
 
 “We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I.
 The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be
 incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If
 you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the
 key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”
 
 “I will do it.”
 
 “Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course
 there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to
 personate some one, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.
 That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is
 the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said
 to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her
 in height, figure, and the color of your hair. Hers had been cut off,
 very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
 course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came
 upon her tresses. The man in the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of
 hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress
 and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever
 he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was
 perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog
 is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavoring to communicate
 with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case
 is the disposition of the child.”
 
 “What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.
 
 “My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as
 to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see
 that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first
 real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.
 This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s
 sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should
 suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in
 their power.”
 
 “I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A
 thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have
 hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor
 creature.”
 
 “We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We
 can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you,
 and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”
 
 We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the
 Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a way-side public-house. The
 group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in
 the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even
 had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.
 
 “Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.
 
 A loud thudding noise came from somewhere down-stairs. “That is
 Mrs. Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on
 the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.
 Rucastle’s.”
 
 “You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes, with enthusiasm. “Now lead
 the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”
 
 We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,
 and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had
 described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he
 tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came
 from within, and at the silence Holmes’s face clouded over.
 
 “I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter,
 that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to
 it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”
 
 It was an old rickety door, and gave at once before our united
 strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no
 furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of
 linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.
 
 “There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has
 guessed Miss Hunter’s intentions, and has carried his victim off.”
 
 “But how?”
 
 “Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung
 himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried; “here’s the end of a
 long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”
 
 “But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there
 when the Rucastles went away.”
 
 “He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
 dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he
 whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be
 as well for you to have your pistol ready.”
 
 The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the
 door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his
 hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of
 him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.
 
 “You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”
 
 The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.
 
 “It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and
 thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve
 you!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.
 
 “He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.
 
 “I have my revolver,” said I.
 
 “Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down
 the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the
 baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying
 sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red
 face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
 
 “My God!” he cried. “Some one has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for
 two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”
 
 Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller
 hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle
 buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the
 ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its
 keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With
 much labor we separated them, and carried him, living but horribly
 mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and,
 having despatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I
 did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him
 when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
 
 “Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.
 
 “Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went
 up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were
 planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”
 
 “Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller
 knows more about this matter than any one else.”
 
 “Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”
 
 “Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points
 on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”
 
 “I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done
 so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s
 police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one
 that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.
 
 “She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that
 her father married again. She was slighted like, and had no say in
 anything; but it never really became bad for her until after she met
 Mr. Fowler at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice
 had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she
 was, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in
 Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was
 a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the
 law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on
 it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not,
 he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying
 her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door.
 Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her
 beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young
 man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”
 
 “Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to
 tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all
 that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of
 imprisonment?”
 
 “Yes, sir.”
 
 “And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the
 disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”
 
 “That was it, sir.”
 
 “But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should
 be, blockaded the house, and, having met you, succeeded by certain
 arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests
 were the same as his.”
 
 “Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.
 Toller, serenely.
 
 “And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of
 drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master
 had gone out.”
 
 “You have it, sir, just as it happened.”
 
 “I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you
 have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes
 the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had
 best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our
 _locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.”
 
 And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper
 beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a
 broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.
 They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of
 Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.
 Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in
 Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a
 Government appointment in the Island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet
 Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no
 further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of
 one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
 Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

  CHAPTER L.
 THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE
 
 
 Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe
 abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on
 the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of
 close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the
 strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are
 hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of
 its inhabitants.
 
 To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of
 close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest
 of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to
 occasion. The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the
 shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at
 the salesman’s door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows.
 Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class,
 ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the
 raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along,
 assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which
 branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of
 ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks
 of warehouses that rise from every corner. Arriving, at length, in
 streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has
 passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the
 pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys
 half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron
 bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign
 of desolation and neglect.
 
 In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark,
 stands Jacob’s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet
 deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill
 Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch. It is a creek
 or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by
 opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name.
 At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges
 thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses
 on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets,
 pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up;
 and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses
 themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before
 him. Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses,
 with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken
 and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is
 never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would
 seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter;
 wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening
 to fall into it—as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying
 foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome
 indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of
 Folly Ditch.
 
 In Jacob’s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are
 crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling
 into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.
 Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon
 it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.
 The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by
 those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die.
 They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced
 to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob’s Island.
 
 In an upper room of one of these houses—a detached house of fair size,
 ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of
 which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already
 described—there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other
 every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation,
 sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence. One of these was Toby
 Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years,
 whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose
 face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same
 occasion. This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags.
 
 “I wish,” said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, “that you had picked out
 some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come
 here, my fine feller.”
 
 “Why didn’t you, blunder-head!” said Kags.
 
 “Well, I thought you’d have been a little more glad to see me than
 this,” replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.
 
 “Why, look’e, young gentleman,” said Toby, “when a man keeps himself so
 very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over
 his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it’s rather a
 startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman
 (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with
 at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.”
 
 “Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping
 with him, that’s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts,
 and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,”
 added Mr. Kags.
 
 There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon
 as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care
 swagger, turned to Chitling and said,
 
 “When was Fagin took then?”
 
 “Just at dinner-time—two o’clock this afternoon. Charley and I made our
 lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water-butt,
 head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out
 at the top, and so they took him too.”
 
 “And Bet?”
 
 “Poor Bet! She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,” replied
 Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, “and went off mad,
 screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they
 put a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital—and there she
 is.”
 
 “Wot’s come of young Bates?” demanded Kags.
 
 “He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he’ll be here
 soon,” replied Chitling. “There’s nowhere else to go to now, for the
 people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken—I
 went up there and see it with my own eyes—is filled with traps.”
 
 “This is a smash,” observed Toby, biting his lips. “There’s more than
 one will go with this.”
 
 “The sessions are on,” said Kags: “if they get the inquest over, and
 Bolter turns King’s evidence: as of course he will, from what he’s said
 already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the
 trial on on Friday, and he’ll swing in six days from this, by G—!”
 
 “You should have heard the people groan,” said Chitling; “the officers
 fought like devils, or they’d have torn him away. He was down once, but
 they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should have
 seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them
 as if they were his dearest friends. I can see ’em now, not able to
 stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along
 amongst ’em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and
 snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon
 his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked
 themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore
 they’d tear his heart out!”
 
 The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his
 ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro,
 like one distracted.
 
 While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their
 eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs,
 and Sikes’s dog bounded into the room. They ran to the window,
 downstairs, and into the street. The dog had jumped in at an open
 window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be
 seen.
 
 “What’s the meaning of this?” said Toby when they had returned. “He
 can’t be coming here. I—I—hope not.”
 
 “If he was coming here, he’d have come with the dog,” said Kags,
 stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.
 “Here! Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.”
 
 “He’s drunk it all up, every drop,” said Chitling after watching the
 dog some time in silence. “Covered with mud—lame—half blind—he must
 have come a long way.”
 
 “Where can he have come from!” exclaimed Toby. “He’s been to the other
 kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here,
 where he’s been many a time and often. But where can he have come from
 first, and how comes he here alone without the other!”
 
 “He”—(none of them called the murderer by his old name)—“He can’t have
 made away with himself. What do you think?” said Chitling.
 
 Toby shook his head.
 
 “If he had,” said Kags, “the dog ’ud want to lead us away to where he
 did it. No. I think he’s got out of the country, and left the dog
 behind. He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn’t be so
 easy.”
 
 This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the
 right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep,
 without more notice from anybody.
 
 It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and
 placed upon the table. The terrible events of the last two days had
 made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and
 uncertainty of their own position. They drew their chairs closer
 together, starting at every sound. They spoke little, and that in
 whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the
 murdered woman lay in the next room.
 
 They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried
 knocking at the door below.
 
 “Young Bates,” said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he
 felt himself.
 
 The knocking came again. No, it wasn’t he. He never knocked like that.
 
 Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head.
 There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough.
 The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the
 door.
 
 “We must let him in,” he said, taking up the candle.
 
 “Isn’t there any help for it?” asked the other man in a hoarse voice.
 
 “None. He _must_ come in.”
 
 “Don’t leave us in the dark,” said Kags, taking down a candle from the
 chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the
 knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.
 
 Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the
 lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over
 his head under his hat. He drew them slowly off. Blanched face, sunken
 eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days’ growth, wasted flesh, short
 thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.
 
 He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room,
 but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance
 over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall—as close as it
 would go—and ground it against it—and sat down.
 
 Not a word had been exchanged. He looked from one to another in
 silence. If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly
 averted. When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.
 They seemed never to have heard its tones before.
 
 “How came that dog here?” he asked.
 
 “Alone. Three hours ago.”
 
 “To-night’s paper says that Fagin’s took. Is it true, or a lie?”
 
 “True.”
 
 They were silent again.
 
 “Damn you all!” said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead. “Have
 you nothing to say to me?”
 
 There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.
 
 “You that keep this house,” said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit,
 “do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?”
 
 “You may stop here, if you think it safe,” returned the person
 addressed, after some hesitation.
 
 Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to
 turn his head than actually doing it: and said, “Is—it—the body—is it
 buried?”
 
 They shook their heads.
 
 “Why isn’t it!” he retorted with the same glance behind him. “Wot do
 they keep such ugly things above the ground for?—Who’s that knocking?”
 
 Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that
 there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates
 behind him. Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy
 entered the room he encountered his figure.
 
 “Toby,” said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards
 him, “why didn’t you tell me this, downstairs?”
 
 There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the
 three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad.
 Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with
 him.
 
 “Let me go into some other room,” said the boy, retreating still
 farther.
 
 “Charley!” said Sikes, stepping forward. “Don’t you—don’t you know me?”
 
 “Don’t come nearer me,” answered the boy, still retreating, and
 looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer’s face. “You
 monster!”
 
 The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes’s
 eyes sunk gradually to the ground.
 
 “Witness you three,” cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and
 becoming more and more excited as he spoke. “Witness you three—I’m not
 afraid of him—if they come here after him, I’ll give him up; I will. I
 tell you out at once. He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he
 dares, but if I am here I’ll give him up. I’d give him up if he was to
 be boiled alive. Murder! Help! If there’s the pluck of a man among you
 three, you’ll help me. Murder! Help! Down with him!”
 
 Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent
 gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the
 strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of
 his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.
 
 The three spectators seemed quite stupefied. They offered no
 interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the
 former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his
 hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer’s breast,
 and never ceasing to call for help with all his might.
 
 The contest, however, was too unequal to last long. Sikes had him down,
 and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a
 look of alarm, and pointed to the window. There were lights gleaming
 below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried
 footsteps—endless they seemed in number—crossing the nearest wooden
 bridge. One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there
 was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement. The gleam of
 lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. Then,
 came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a
 multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.
 
 “Help!” shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air. “He’s here!
 Break down the door!”
 
 “In the King’s name,” cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry
 arose again, but louder.
 
 “Break down the door!” screamed the boy. “I tell you they’ll never open
 it. Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the door!”
 
 Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower
 window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the
 crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of
 its immense extent.
 
 “Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching
 Hell-babe,” cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the
 boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. “That door. Quick!” He
 flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. “Is the downstairs door
 fast?”
 
 “Double-locked and chained,” replied Crackit, who, with the other two
 men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.
 
 “The panels—are they strong?”
 
 “Lined with sheet-iron.”
 
 “And the windows too?”
 
 “Yes, and the windows.”
 
 “Damn you!” cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and
 menacing the crowd. “Do your worst! I’ll cheat you yet!”
 
 Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could
 exceed the cry of the infuriated throng. Some shouted to those who were
 nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to
 shoot him dead. Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on
 horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting
 through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the
 window, in a voice that rose above all others, “Twenty guineas to the
 man who brings a ladder!”
 
 The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. Some called
 for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro
 as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent
 their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward
 with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those
 below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout
 and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness
 beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from
 time to time in one loud furious roar.
 
 “The tide,” cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and
 shut the faces out, “the tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a
 long rope. They’re all in front. I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and
 clear off that way. Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders
 and kill myself.”
 
 The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the
 murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up
 to the house-top.
 
 All the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up,
 except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that
 was too small even for the passage of his body. But, from this
 aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the
 back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by
 the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in
 front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in
 an unbroken stream.
 
 He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose,
 so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty
 to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over
 the low parapet.
 
 The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.
 
 The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his
 motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it
 and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to
 which all their previous shouting had been whispers. Again and again it
 rose. Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took
 up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole
 city had poured its population out to curse him.
 
 On pressed the people from the front—on, on, on, in a strong struggling
 current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten
 them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion. The houses
 on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes
 were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces
 in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every
 house-top. Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent
 beneath the weight of the crowd upon it. Still the current poured on to
 find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an
 instant see the wretch.
 
 “They have him now,” cried a man on the nearest bridge. “Hurrah!”
 
 The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.
 
 “I will give fifty pounds,” cried an old gentleman from the same
 quarter, “to the man who takes him alive. I will remain here, till he
 come to ask me for it.”
 
 There was another roar. At this moment the word was passed among the
 crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first
 called for the ladder had mounted into the room. The stream abruptly
 turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at
 the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their
 stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now
 thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left: each man crushing and
 striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near
 the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out.
 The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation,
 or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were
 dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time,
 between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and
 the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the
 mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer,
 although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible,
 increased.
 
 The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the
 crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change
 with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet,
 determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the
 ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in
 the darkness and confusion.
 
 Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within
 the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he
 set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the
 rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong
 running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second. He
 could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the
 ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut
 it then and drop.
 
 At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to
 slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman
 before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge
 as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly
 warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down—at
 that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw
 his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.
 
 “The eyes again!” he cried in an unearthly screech.
 
 Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled
 over the parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight,
 tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. He fell for
 five-and-thirty feet. There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of
 the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his
 stiffening hand.
 
 The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The
 murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside
 the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come
 and take him out, for God’s sake.
 
 A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on
 the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring,
 jumped for the dead man’s shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the
 ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head
 against a stone, dashed out his brains.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER LI.
 AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING
 A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY
 
 
 The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when
 Oliver found himself, at three o’clock in the afternoon, in a
 travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town. Mrs. Maylie,
 and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr.
 Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person
 whose name had not been mentioned.
 
 They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of
 agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting
 his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less
 effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.
 He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr.
 Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from
 Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey
 was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole
 matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in
 endurance of the most intense suspense.
 
 The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne’s assistance, cautiously
 stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive
 intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.
 “It was quite true,” he said, “that they must know them before long,
 but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be
 at a worse.” So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with
 reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one
 disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.
 
 But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they
 journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the
 whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a
 crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into
 that which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy,
 without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.
 
 “See there, there!” cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose,
 and pointing out at the carriage window; “that’s the stile I came over;
 there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake
 me and force me back! Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to
 the old house where I was a little child! Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old
 friend, if I could only see you now!”
 
 “You will see him soon,” replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands
 between her own. “You shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich
 you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great
 as the coming back to make him happy too.”
 
 “Yes, yes,” said Oliver, “and we’ll—we’ll take him away from here, and
 have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place
 where he may grow strong and well,—shall we?”
 
 Rose nodded “yes,” for the boy was smiling through such happy tears
 that she could not speak.
 
 “You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,” said
 Oliver. “It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but
 never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again—I
 know that too—to think how changed he is; you did the same with me. He
 said ‘God bless you’ to me when I ran away,” cried the boy with a burst
 of affectionate emotion; “and I will say ‘God bless you’ now, and show
 him how I love him for it!”
 
 As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow
 streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy
 within reasonable bounds. There was Sowerberry’s the undertaker’s just
 as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he
 remembered it—there were all the well-known shops and houses, with
 almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected—there
 was Gamfield’s cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old
 public-house door—there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his
 youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street—there was
 the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver
 involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so
 foolish, then cried, then laughed again—there were scores of faces at
 the doors and windows that he knew quite well—there was nearly
 everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life
 had been but a happy dream.
 
 But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. They drove straight to the
 door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe,
 and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur
 and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing
 the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as
 if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness,
 and not offering to eat his head—no, not once; not even when he
 contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and
 maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and
 that time fast asleep. There was dinner prepared, and there were
 bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.
 
 Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was
 over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their
 journey down. Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in
 a separate room. The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with
 anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present,
 conversed apart. Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being
 absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping. All
 these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets,
 nervous and uncomfortable. They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they
 exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to
 hear the sound of their own voices.
 
 At length, when nine o’clock had come, and they began to think they
 were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered
 the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost
 shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother,
 and it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking
 in with Fagin at the window of his little room. Monks cast a look of
 hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy,
 and sat down near the door. Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand,
 walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.
 
 “This is a painful task,” said he, “but these declarations, which have
 been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance
 repeated here. I would have spared you the degradation, but we must
 hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.”
 
 “Go on,” said the person addressed, turning away his face. “Quick. I
 have almost done enough, I think. Don’t keep me here.”
 
 “This child,” said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his
 hand upon his head, “is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your
 father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who
 died in giving him birth.”
 
 “Yes,” said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose
 heart he might have heard. “That is the bastard child.”
 
 “The term you use,” said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, “is a reproach to those
 long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects
 disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass. He was
 born in this town.”
 
 “In the workhouse of this town,” was the sullen reply. “You have the
 story there.” He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.
 
 “I must have it here, too,” said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the
 listeners.
 
 “Listen then! You!” returned Monks. “His father being taken ill at
 Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long
 separated, who went from Paris and took me with her—to look after his
 property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor
 he for her. He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he
 slumbered on till next day, when he died. Among the papers in his desk,
 were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to
 yourself”; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; “and enclosed in a few
 short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that
 it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead. One of these papers
 was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.”
 
 “What of the letter?” asked Mr. Brownlow.
 
 “The letter?—A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a
 penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her. He had palmed a
 tale on the girl that some secret mystery—to be explained one
 day—prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on,
 trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what
 none could ever give her back. She was, at that time, within a few
 months of her confinement. He told her all he had meant to do, to hide
 her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse
 his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on
 her or their young child; for all the guilt was his. He reminded her of
 the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her
 christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he
 hoped one day to have bestowed upon her—prayed her yet to keep it, and
 wear it next her heart, as she had done before—and then ran on, wildly,
 in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted. I
 believe he had.”
 
 “The will,” said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver’s tears fell fast.
 
 Monks was silent.
 
 “The will,” said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, “was in the same
 spirit as the letter. He talked of miseries which his wife had brought
 upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature
 bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and
 left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The
 bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions—one for Agnes
 Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and
 ever come of age. If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money
 unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his
 minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of
 dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong. He did this, he said, to mark
 his confidence in the mother, and his conviction—only strengthened by
 approaching death—that the child would share her gentle heart, and
 noble nature. If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the
 money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both
 children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his
 purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed
 him with coldness and aversion.”
 
 “My mother,” said Monks, in a louder tone, “did what a woman should
 have done. She burnt this will. The letter never reached its
 destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever
 tried to lie away the blot. The girl’s father had the truth from her
 with every aggravation that her violent hate—I love her for it
 now—could add. Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children
 into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his friends
 might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards,
 he was found dead in his bed. The girl had left her home, in secret,
 some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and
 village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that
 she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old
 heart broke.”
 
 There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread
 of the narrative.
 
 “Years after this,” he said, “this man’s—Edward Leeford’s—mother came
 to me. He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and
 money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two
 years he had associated with the lowest outcasts. She was sinking under
 a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she
 died. Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were
 unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back
 with her to France.”
 
 “There she died,” said Monks, “after a lingering illness; and, on her
 death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her
 unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved—though she
 need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before. She
 would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child
 too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been
 born, and was alive. I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to
 hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and
 most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply
 felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by
 dragging it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot. She was right. He
 came in my way at last. I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I
 would have finished as I began!”
 
 As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on
 himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the
 terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been
 his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver
 ensnared: of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his
 being rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit
 to the country house for the purpose of identifying him.
 
 “The locket and ring?” said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.
 
 “I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them
 from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,” answered Monks without
 raising his eyes. “You know what became of them.”
 
 Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great
 alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her
 unwilling consort after him.
 
 “Do my hi’s deceive me!” cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,
 “or is that little Oliver? Oh O-li-ver, if you know’d how I’ve been
 a-grieving for you—”
 
 “Hold your tongue, fool,” murmured Mrs. Bumble.
 
 “Isn’t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?” remonstrated the workhouse master.
 “Can’t I be supposed to feel—_I_ as brought him up porochially—when I
 see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest
 description! I always loved that boy as if he’d been my—my—my own
 grandfather,” said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.
 “Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the
 white waistcoat? Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with
 plated handles, Oliver.”
 
 “Come, sir,” said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; “suppress your feelings.”
 
 “I will do my endeavours, sir,” replied Mr. Bumble. “How do you do,
 sir? I hope you are very well.”
 
 This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to
 within a short distance of the respectable couple. He inquired, as he
 pointed to Monks,
 
 “Do you know that person?”
 
 “No,” replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.
 
 “Perhaps _you_ don’t?” said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse.
 
 “I never saw him in all my life,” said Mr. Bumble.
 
 “Nor sold him anything, perhaps?”
 
 “No,” replied Mrs. Bumble.
 
 “You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?” said Mr.
 Brownlow.
 
 “Certainly not,” replied the matron. “Why are we brought here to answer
 to such nonsense as this?”
 
 Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman
 limped away with extraordinary readiness. But not again did he return
 with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women,
 who shook and tottered as they walked.
 
 “You shut the door the night old Sally died,” said the foremost one,
 raising her shrivelled hand, “but you couldn’t shut out the sound, nor
 stop the chinks.”
 
 “No, no,” said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless
 jaws. “No, no, no.”
 
 “We heard her try to tell you what she’d done, and saw you take a paper
 from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker’s
 shop,” said the first.
 
 “Yes,” added the second, “and it was a ‘locket and gold ring.’ We found
 out that, and saw it given you. We were by. Oh! we were by.”
 
 “And we know more than that,” resumed the first, “for she told us
 often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she
 should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was
 taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.”
 
 “Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?” asked Mr. Grimwig with
 a motion towards the door.
 
 “No,” replied the woman; “if he”—she pointed to Monks—“has been coward
 enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags
 till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say. I _did_
 sell them, and they’re where you’ll never get them. What then?”
 
 “Nothing,” replied Mr. Brownlow, “except that it remains for us to take
 care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again. You
 may leave the room.”
 
 “I hope,” said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as
 Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: “I hope that this
 unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial
 office?”
 
 “Indeed it will,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “You may make up your mind to
 that, and think yourself well off besides.”
 
 “It was all Mrs. Bumble. She _would_ do it,” urged Mr. Bumble; first
 looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.
 
 “That is no excuse,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “You were present on the
 occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more
 guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that
 your wife acts under your direction.”
 
 “If the law supposes that,” said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat
 emphatically in both hands, “the law is a ass—a idiot. If that’s the
 eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is,
 that his eye may be opened by experience—by experience.”
 
 Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble
 fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets,
 followed his helpmate downstairs.
 
 “Young lady,” said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, “give me your hand.
 Do not tremble. You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we
 have to say.”
 
 “If they have—I do not know how they can, but if they have—any
 reference to me,” said Rose, “pray let me hear them at some other time.
 I have not strength or spirits now.”
 
 “Nay,” returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; “you
 have more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know this young lady,
 sir?”
 
 “Yes,” replied Monks.
 
 “I never saw you before,” said Rose faintly.
 
 “I have seen you often,” returned Monks.
 
 “The father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,” said Mr.
 Brownlow. “What was the fate of the other—the child?”
 
 “The child,” replied Monks, “when her father died in a strange place,
 in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that
 yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be
 traced—the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as
 their own.”
 
 “Go on,” said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. “Go
 on!”
 
 “You couldn’t find the spot to which these people had repaired,” said
 Monks, “but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way. My
 mother found it, after a year of cunning search—ay, and found the
 child.”
 
 “She took it, did she?”
 
 “No. The people were poor and began to sicken—at least the man did—of
 their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small
 present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which
 she never meant to send. She didn’t quite rely, however, on their
 discontent and poverty for the child’s unhappiness, but told the
 history of the sister’s shame, with such alterations as suited her;
 bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and
 told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or
 other. The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it;
 and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to
 satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the
 girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home. There was some cursed
 spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she
 remained there and was happy. I lost sight of her, two or three years
 ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.”
 
 “Do you see her now?”
 
 “Yes. Leaning on your arm.”
 
 “But not the less my niece,” cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting
 girl in her arms; “not the less my dearest child. I would not lose her
 now, for all the treasures of the world. My sweet companion, my own
 dear girl!”
 
 “The only friend I ever had,” cried Rose, clinging to her. “The
 kindest, best of friends. My heart will burst. I cannot bear all this.”
 
 “You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest
 creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,” said Mrs.
 Maylie, embracing her tenderly. “Come, come, my love, remember who this
 is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here—look, look,
 my dear!”
 
 “Not aunt,” cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; “I’ll never
 call her aunt—sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my
 heart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling Rose!”
 
 Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in
 the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred. A father,
",OliverTwist
56," 
 When he went away she looked happier, or at least quieter. He cursed
 himself for a fool when he got into the car. But still against his hand
 he felt the softness of her cheek and the fear of unmanly tears made him
 exceed the speed limit.
 
 Margaret, left alone, calculated her resources and for all her whilom
 amazing vanity found them poor and wanting. What would Gabriel say to
 her this morning, how could she answer him? If he truly loved her and
 she pointed out to him, proved to him that their marriage, their
 happiness, need not be postponed, would he listen? She saw herself
 persuading him, but remembered that her father in many an argument had
 failed in making him admit that there was more than one standard of
 ethics, of right conduct. If he truly loved her! In this black moment
 she could doubt it. For unlike Peter Kennedy he would put honour before
 her love.
 
 Gabriel, her lover, came late, on slow reluctant feet. He loved her no
 less, although he knew she had deceived him, kept things back from him,
 complicated, perhaps, both their lives by her action. He knew her
 motives also, that it was because she loved him. He had no harsh
 judgment, only an overwhelming pang of tenderness. He, too, had faced
 the immediate future. He knew there must be no marriage whilst this
 thing hung over and menaced them. Yet to take her into his own keeping,
 guard and cherish her, was a desire sharp as a sword is sharp, and too
 poignant for words. He thought she would understand him. But more
 definitely perhaps he feared her opposition. The fear had slowed his
 feet. She did not know her lover when she dreaded his reproaches. When
 he came into the music room this grey, wet morning, he saw that she
 looked ill, but hardly guessed that she was apprehensive, and of him. He
 bent over her hands, kissed her hands, held them against his lips.
 
 “My dear, my dear.” Her mercurial spirits rose at a bound.
 
 “I thought you would reproach me.”
 
 “My poor darling!”
 
 “I wish I had told you.”
 
 “Never mind that now.”
 
 “But that was the worst of everything. You don’t know how I have
 reproached myself.”
 
 “You must not.”
 
 “You have not left off caring for me, then?”
 
 “I never cared for you so much.”
 
 “Why do you look so grave, so serious?”
 
 Her heart was shaking as she questioned him. In his tenderness there was
 something different, something inflexible.
 
 “My darling,” he said again.
 
 “That means...?”
 
 “I am going to ask you to let me stop that cheque.”
 
 “No.”
 
 “Fortunately it is Sunday. We have the day before us. I am going up by
 the two-o’clock. I’ve sent my bag down to the station. I’ve already been
 on to my lawyer by telephone and he will see me at his private house
 this afternoon. In my opinion we have nothing at all to fear. The King’s
 Proctor will not move on such evidence as she has to offer, she has
 overreached herself. We ought to have her in gaol by tomorrow night.”
 
 “In gaol!”
 
 “That is where she should be. She frightened you ... she shall go to
 gaol for it. Margaret, will you write to your bankers ... let me
 write....”
 
 “No!” she said again.
 
 “Sweetheart!” and he caressed her.
 
 “No. Gabriel, listen to me. I am overwhelmed because I broke my promise
 to you, was not candid. But though I am overwhelmed and unhappy....”
 
 “I will not let you be unhappy....”
 
 She brushed that aside and went on:
 
 “I am not sorry for what I have done. There is not a word of truth in
 what she says. As you say, I have admitted guilt, being innocent.
 Gabriel, I was innocent before, but racked, tortured to prove it. Here I
 have only paid five hundred pounds. Oh, Heaven! give me words, the power
 to show you. I am pleading with you for my life. For my life,
 Gabriel ... ours. Let the cheque go through, give her another if
 necessary, and yet another. I don’t mind buying my happiness.” She
 pleaded wildly.
 
 “Hush! Hush!” He hushed her on his breast, held her to him.
 
 “Dear love....” She wept, and the tortures of which she spoke were his.
 “If only I might yield to you.”
 
 “What is it stops you? Obstinacy, self-righteousness....”
 
 “If it were either would I not yield now, now, with your dear head upon
 my breast?” She was sobbing there. “Dear love, you unman me.” His
 breathing was irregular. “Listen, you unman me, you weaken me. We were
 both looking forward, and must still be able to look forward. And
 backward, too. Not stain our name, more than our name, our own personal
 honour. Margaret, we are clean, there must be no one who can say, ‘Had
 they been innocent, would they have paid to hide it?’ And this fresh
 charge, this fresh and hideous accusation! And you would accept all,
 admit all! My dear, my dear, it must not be, we have not only ourselves
 to consider.”
 
 “Not only ourselves!” He held her closer, whispered in her ear.
 
 She had heard him discuss commercial morality with her father, had seen
 into both their souls; learnt her lover’s creed. One must not best a
 fellowman, fool though he might be, nor take advantage of his need nor
 ignorance. She had learnt that there were such things as undue
 percentage of profit, although no man might know what that profit was.
 “Child’s talk,” her father had called it, and told him Wall Street would
 collapse in a day if his tenets were to hold good. Margaret had been
 proud of him then, although secretly her reason had failed to support
 him, for it is hard to upset the teaching of a lifetime. To her, it
 seemed there were conventions, but common sense or convenience might
 override them. In this particular instance why should she not submit to
 blackmail, paying for the freedom she needed? But he could not be
 brought to see eye to eye with her in this. She used all the power that
 was in her to prove to him that there is no sharp line of demarcation
 between right and wrong, that one can steer a middle course.
 
 The short morning went by whilst she argued. She put forth all her
 powers, and in the end, quite suddenly, became conscious that she had
 not moved him in the least, that as he thought when he came into the
 room, so he thought now. He used the same words, the same hopeless
 unarguable words. “Being innocent we cannot put in this plea of guilty.”
 She would neither listen nor talk any more, but lay as a wrestler, who,
 after battling again and again until the whistle blew and the respite
 came, feels both shoulders touching the ground, and suddenly, without
 appeal, admits defeat.
 
 When Gabriel wrote the letter to the bank stopping the cheque that was
 to be paid to Mrs. Roope on the morrow, she signed it silently. When he
 asked her to authorise him to see her father if necessary, to allow
 either or both of them to act for her, she acquiesced in the same way.
 She was quite spent and exhausted.
 
 “I will let you know everything we do, every step we take.”
 
 “I don’t want to hear.” She accepted his caresses without returning
 them, she had no capacity left for any emotion.
 
 Then, after he had gone, for there was no time to spare and he must not
 miss his train, she remained immobile for a time, the panorama of the
 future unfolding before her exhausted brain. What a panorama it was! She
 was familiar with every sickening scene that passed before her. Lawyer’s
 office, documents going to and fro, delay and yet more delay. Appeal to
 Judge in Chambers, and from Judge in Chambers, interrogatories and yet
 more interrogatories, demands for further particulars, the further
 particulars questioned; Counsel’s opinion, the case set down for
 hearing, adjournments and yet further adjournments.
 
 At last the Court. Speeches. And then, standing behind the rail in the
 witness-box, the cynosure of all eyes, she saw herself as in the stocks,
 for all to pelt with mud ... herself, her wretched, cowering self!
 Gabriel said they were clean people; she and he were clean. So far they
 were, but they would be pelted with mud nevertheless; perhaps all the
 more because their cleanliness would make so tempting a target. The
 judge would find the mud-flinging entertaining, would interpolate
 facetious remarks. The Christian Science element would give him
 opportunity. The court would be crowded to suffocation. She felt the
 closeness and the musty air, and felt her heart contract ... but not
 expand. That slight cramp woke her from her dreadful dream, but woke her
 to terror. Such a warning she had had before. She was able, however, to
 ring for help. Stevens came running and began to administer all the
 domestic remedies, rating her at the same time for having “brought it on
 herself,” grumbling and reminding her of all her imprudences.
 
 “No breakfast, and lunch not up yet; I never did see such goin’s-on.”
 
 She had the sense, however, in the midst of her grumbling to send for
 the doctor, and before the pain was at its height he was in the room.
 The bitter-sweet smell of the amyl told him what had been already done.
 What little more he could do brought her no relief. He took out the case
 he always carried, hesitated, and chose a small bottle.
 
 “Get me some hot water,” he said, to Stevens.
 
 “Morphia?” she gasped.
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Put it away.”
 
 “Because it failed once is no reason it should fail again.”
 
 “I’m in ... I’m in ... agony.”
 
 “I know.”
 
 “And there’s no hope.”
 
 “Oh, yes, you’ll get through this.”
 
 “I don’t want to ... only not to suffer. Remember, you promised.” He
 pretended not to hear, busying himself about her.
 
 “He has gone. I’ve stopped the cheque. Peter....” The pain rose, her
 voice with it, then collapsed; it was dreadful to see her.
 
 “Help me ... give me the hyoscine,” she said faintly. His hand shook,
 his face was ashen. “I can’t bear this ... you promised.” The agony
 broke over her again. He poured down brandy, but it might have been
 water. His heart was wrung, and drops of perspiration formed upon his
 forehead. She pleaded to him in that faint voice, then was past
 pleading, and could only suffer, then began again:
 
 “Pity me. Do something ... let me go; help me....”
 
 One has to recollect that he loved her, that he knew her heart was
 diseased, that there would be other such attacks. Also that Gabriel
 Stanton, as he feared, had proved inflexible. There would be no wedding
 and inevitable publicity. Then she cried to him again. And Stevens took
 up the burden of her cry.
 
 “For the Lord’s sake give her something, give her what she’s asking for.
 Human nature can’t bear no more ... look at her.” Stevens was moved, as
 any woman would be, or man, either, by such suffering.
 
 “Your promise!” were words that were wrung through her dry lips. Her
 tortured eyes raked and racked him.
 
 “I ... I can’t,” was all the answer.
 
 “If you care, if you ever cared. Your miserable weakness. Oh, if I only
 had a man about me!” She turned away from him for ease and he could
 hardly hear her. In the next paroxysm he lifted her gently on to the
 floor, placed a pillow under her head. He whispered to her, but she
 repelled him, entreated her, but she would not listen. All the time the
 pain went on. “You promised,” were not words,—but a moan.
 
 Desperately he took the cachet from the wrong bottle, melted it, filled
 his needle. When he bade Stevens roll up her sleeve, she smiled on him,
 actually smiled.
 
 “Dear Peter! How right I was to trust you!...” Her voice trailed. The
 change in her face was almost miraculous, the writhing body relaxed. She
 sighed. Almost it seemed as if the colour came back to her lips, to her
 tortured face. “Dear, good Peter,” were her last words, a message he
 stooped to hear.
 
 “Thank the Lord,” said Stevens piously, “she’s getting easier.” She was
 still lying on the floor, a pillow under her head, and they watched her
 silently.
 
 “Shall I lift her back?”
 
 “No, leave her a few minutes.” He had the sense to add, “The morphia
 doesn’t usually act so quickly.” Stevens had seen him give her morphia
 before in the same way, with the same preliminaries. He had saved her,
 he must save himself. He was conscious now of nothing but gladness. He
 had feared his strength, but his strength had been equal to her need.
 She was out of pain. Nothing else mattered. She was out of pain, he had
 promised her and been equal to his promise. He was no Gabriel Stanton to
 argue and deny, deny and argue. He wiped his needle carefully, put it
 away. Then a cry from Stevens roused him, brought him quickly to her
 side.
 
 “She’s gone. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! She’s gone!” He lifted her up, laid her
 on the sofa, the smile was still on her face, she looked asleep. But
 Stevens was there and he had to dissimulate.
 
 “She is unconscious. Get on to the telephone. Ask Dr. Lansdowne to come
 over.”
 
 Then he made a feint of trying remedies. Strychnine, more amyl, more
 brandy, artificial respiration. He was glad, glad, glad, exulting as the
 moments went on. He thanked God that she was at rest. “_He giveth His
 beloved sleep._” He called her beloved, whispered it in her ear when
 Stevens was summoning that useless help. He had sealed her to him, she
 was his woman now, and for ever. No self-righteous iceberg could hold
 and deny her.
 
 “Sleep well, beloved,” he whispered. “Sleep well. Smile on me, smile
 your thanks.”
 
 He recovered himself with an immense, an incredible effort. He wanted to
 laugh, to exult, to call on the world to see his work, what he had done
 for her, how peaceful she was, and happy. He was as near madness as a
 sane man could be, but by the time his partner came he composed his face
 and spoke with professional gravity:
 
 “I am afraid you are too late.”
 
 Dr. Lansdowne, hurrying in, wore his habitual grin.
 
 “I always knew it would end like this. Didn’t I tell you so? An
 aneurism. I diagnosed it a long time ago.” He had even forgotten his
 diagnosis. “I suppose you’ve tried ... so and so?” He recapitulated the
 remedies. Stevens, stunned by the calamity, but not so far as to make
 her forget to pull down the blinds, listened and realised Dr. Kennedy
 had left nothing undone.
 
 “I suppose there will have to be an inquest?”
 
 “An inquest! My dear fellow. _An inquest!_ What for? I have seen her and
 diagnosed, prognosed. You have attended her for weeks under my
 direction. Unless her family wish it, it is quite unnecessary. I shall
 be most pleased to give a death certificate. You have informed the
 relatives, of course?”
 
 “Not yet.”
 
 Stevens emitted one dry sob which represented her entire emotional
 capacity, and hastened to ring up Queen Anne’s Gate. Dr. Lansdowne began
 to talk directly she left them alone. He told his silent colleague of an
 eructation that troubled him after meals, and of a faint tendency to
 gout. Then cast a perfunctory glance at the sofa.
 
 “Pretty woman!” he said. “All that money, too!”
 
 Peter, suddenly, inexplicably unable to stand, sank on his knees by the
 sofa, hid his face in her dress. Dr. Lansdowne said. “God bless my
 soul!” Peter broke into tears like a girl.
 
 “Come, come, this will never do. Pull yourself together, or I shall
 think.... I shan’t know what to think....”
 
 Peter recovered himself as quickly as he had collapsed, rose to his
 feet.
 
 “It was so sudden,” he said apologetically. “I was unprepared....”
 
 “I could have told you exactly what would happen. The case could hardly
 have ended any other way.”
 
 He said a few kind words about himself and his skill as a diagnostician.
 Peter listened meekly, and was rewarded by the offer of a lift home.
 “You can come up again later, when the family has arrived, they will be
 sure to want to know about her last moments.... Or I might come myself,
 tell them I foresaw it....”
 
 
 
 
                               CHAPTER XVI
 
 
 I woke up suddenly. A minute ago I had seen Peter Kennedy kneeling by
 the sofa, his head against Margaret’s dress. He had looked young, little
 more than a boy. Now he was by my side, bending over me. There was grey
 in his hair, lines about his face.
 
 “You’ve grown grey,” was the first thing I said, feebly enough I’ve no
 doubt, and he did not seem to hear me. “My arm aches. How could you do
 it?”
 
 “Do what?”
 
 “She was so young, so impetuous, everything might have come right....”
 
 “She is wandering,” he said. I hardly knew to whom he spoke, but felt
 the necessity of protest.
 
 “I’m not wandering. Is Ella there?”
 
 “Of course I am. Is there anything you want?” She came over to me.
 
 “I needn’t write any more, need I? I’m so tired.” Ella looked at him as
 if for instructions, or guidance, and he answered soothingly, as one
 speaks to a child or an invalid:
 
 “No, no, certainly not. You need not write until you feel inclined. She
 has been dreaming,” he explained.
 
 It did not seem worth while to contradict him again. I was not
 wide-awake yet, but swayed on the borderland between dreams and reality.
 Three people were in the dusk of the well-known room. They disentangled
 themselves gradually; Nurse Benham, Dr. Kennedy, Ella in the easy-chair,
 Margaret’s easy-chair. It was evening and I heard Dr. Kennedy say that I
 was better, stronger, that he did not think it necessary to give me a
 morphia injection.
 
 “Or hyoscine.”
 
 I am sure I said that, although no one answered me, and it was as if the
 words had dissolved in the twilight of the room. Incidentally I may say
 I never had an injection of morphia since that evening. I knew how easy
 it was to make a mistake with drugs. So many vials look alike in that
 small valise doctors carry. I was either cunning or clever that night in
 rejecting it. Afterwards it was only necessary to be courageous.
 
 I found it difficult in those first few twilight days of recovering
 consciousness to separate this Dr. Kennedy who came in and out of my
 bedroom from that other Dr. Kennedy, little more than a boy, who had
 wept by the woman he released, the authoress whose story I had just
 written. And my feelings towards him fluctuated considerably. My
 convalescence was very slow and difficult, and I often thought of the
 solution Margaret Capel had found, sometimes enviously, at others with a
 shuddering fear. At these times I could not bear that Dr. Kennedy should
 touch me, his hand on my pulse gave me an inward shiver. At others I
 looked upon him with the deepest interest, wondering if he would do as
 much for me as he had done for her, if his kindness had this meaning.
 For he was kind to me, very kind, and at the beck and call of my
 household by night and day. Ella sent for him if my temperature
 registered half a point higher or lower than she anticipated, any
 symptom or change of symptom was sufficient to send him a peremptory
 message, that he never disregarded. Ella, I could tell, still suspected
 us of being in love with each other, and she dressed me up for his
 visits. Lacy underwear, soft chiffony tea-gowns, silken hose and satin
 or velvet shoes diverted my weakness into happier channel and kept her
 in her right _milieu_.
 
 Then, not all at once, but gradually and almost incredibly the whole
 circumstances changed. Dr. Kennedy came one day full of excitement to
 tell us that a new treatment had been found for my illness. Five hundred
 cases had been treated, of which over four hundred had been cured, the
 rest ameliorated. Of course we were sceptical. Other consultants were
 called in and, not having suggested the treatment, damned it
 wholeheartedly. One or two grudgingly admitted a certain therapeutic
 value in selected cases, but were sure that mine was not one of them!
 The medical world is as difficult to persuade to adventure as an old
 maid in a provincial town. My own tame general practitioner, whom I had
 previously credited with some slight intelligence, was moved to write to
 Dr. Kennedy urging him vehemently to forbear. He was fortunate enough to
 give his reasons, and for me at least they proved conclusive!
 
 On the 27th of May I took my first dose of thirty grains of iodide of
 potassium and spent the rest of the day washing it down with glasses of
 chlorine water masked with lemon. I was still the complete invalid,
 going rapidly downhill; on a water bed, spoon-fed, and reluctantly
 docile in Benham’s hard, yet capable hands. On the 27th of June I was
 walking about the house. By the 27th of July I had put on seventeen
 pounds in weight and had no longer any doubt of the result. I had found
 the dosage at first both nauseous and nauseating. Now I drank it off as
 if it had been champagne. Hope effervesced in every glass. The desire to
 work came back, but without the old irritability. Ella, before she left,
 said I was more like myself than I had been for years. Dr. Kennedy had
 unearthed this new treatment and she extolled him, notwithstanding her
 old prejudices, admitted it was to him we owed my restoration, yet never
 ceased to rally me and comment on the power of love. I agreed with her
 in that, knowing hers had saved me even before the drug began to act. It
 was for her hand I had groped in the darkest hour of all. Even now I
 remember her passionate avowal that she would not let me die, my more
 weakly passionate response that I could not leave her lonely in the
 world. Now we said rude things to each other, as sisters will, with an
 intense sense of happiness and absence of emotion. I criticised Tommy’s
 handwriting, and she retorted that at least she saw it regularly. Whilst
 as for Dennis....
 
 But there was no agony there now to be assuaged. My boy was on his way
 home and the words he had written, the cable that he had sent when he
 heard of my illness, lay near my heart, too sacred to show her. I let
 her think I had not heard from him. Closer even than a sister lies the
 tie between son and mother. Not perhaps between her and her rough Tommy,
 her fair Violet, but between me and my Dennis, my wild erratic genius,
 who could nevertheless pen me those words ... who could send me the
 sweetest love letter that has ever been written.
 
 But this has nothing to do with me and Dr. Peter Kennedy, and the
 curious position between us. For a long time after I began to get well
 it seemed we were like two wary wrestlers, watching for a hold. Only
 that sometimes he seemed to drop all reserves, to make an extraordinary
 _rapprochement_. I might flush, call myself a fool, remember my age, but
 at these times it would really appear as if Ella had some reason in her
 madness, as if he had some personal interest in me. At these times I
 found him nervous, excitable, utterly unlike his professional self. As
 for me I had to preserve my equanimity, ignore or rebuff without
 disturbing my equilibrium. I was fully employed in nursing my new-found
 strength, swallowing perpetually milk and eggs, lying for hours on an
 invalid carriage amid the fading gorse, reconstructing, rebuilding,
 making vows. I had been granted a respite, if not a reprieve, and had to
 prove my worthiness. The desire for work grew irresistible. When I asked
 for leave he combated me, combated me strenuously.
 
 “You are not strong enough, not nearly strong enough. You have built up
 no reserve. You must put on another stone at least before you can
 consider yourself out of the wood.”
 
 “I won’t begin anything new, but that story, the story I wrote in
 water....” I watched him when I said this. I saw his colour rise and his
 lips tremble.
 
 “Oh, yes. I had forgotten about that.” But I saw he had not forgotten.
 “You never saw your midnight visitor again?”—he asked me with an attempt
 at carelessness—“Margaret Capel. Do you remember, in the early days of
 your illness how often you spoke of her, how she haunted you?” He spoke
 lightly, but there was anxiety in his voice, and Fear ... was it Fear I
 saw in his eyes, or indecision? “Since you have begun to get better you
 have never mentioned her name. You were going to write her life ...” he
 went on.
 
 “And death,” I answered to see what he would say. We were feinting now,
 getting closer.
 
 “You know she died of heart disease,” he asked quickly. “There was an
 inquest....”
 
 “I saw her die,” I answered, not very coolly or conclusively. His face
 was very strange and haggard, and I felt sorry for him.
 
 “How strange and vivid dreams can be. Morphia dreams especially,” he
 replied, rather questioningly than assertively.
 
 “I thought you agreed mine were not dreams?”
 
 “Did I? When was that?”
 
 “When you brought me their letters, told me I was foredoomed to write
 her story. Hers and his. I can’t think why you did.”
 
 “Did I say that?”
 
 “More than once. I suppose you thought I was not going to get better.”

 R. D. BLACKMORE’S NOVELS.
 
 
 His descriptions are wonderfully vivid and natural. His pages are
 brightened everywhere with great humor; the quaint, dry turns of
 thought remind you occasionally of Fielding.—_London Times._
 
 Mr. Blackmore always writes like a scholar and a
 gentleman—_Athenæum_, London.
 
 His tales, all of them, are pre-eminently meritorious. They are
 remarkable for their careful elaboration, the conscientious finish of
 their workmanship, their affluence of striking dramatic and narrative
 incident, their close observation and general interpretation of nature,
 their profusion of picturesque description, and their quiet and
 sustained humor. Besides, they are pervaded by a bright and elastic
 atmosphere which diffuses a cheery feeling of healthful and robust
 vigor. While they charm us by their sprightly vivacity and their
 naturalness, they never in the slightest degree transcend the limits
 of delicacy or good taste. While radiating warmth and brightness, they
 are as pure as the new-fallen snow.... Their literary execution is
 admirable, and their dramatic power is as exceptional as their moral
 purity.—_Christian Intelligencer_, N. Y.

       GAUL. pp. iv., 312. Post 8vo, Cloth, $1 25.
 
 In all of Captain King’s stories the author holds to lofty ideals of
 manhood and womanhood, and inculcates the lessons of honor, generosity,
 courage, and self-control.—_Literary World_, Boston.
 
 The vivacity and charm which signally distinguish Captain King’s
 pen.... He occupies a position in American literature entirely
 his own.... His is the literature of honest sentiment, pure and
 tender.—_N. Y. Press._
 
 A romance by Captain King is always a pleasure, because he has so
 complete a mastery of the subjects with which he deals.... Captain
 King has few rivals in his domain.... The general tone of Captain
 King’s stories is highly commendable. The heroes are simple, frank,
 and soldierly; the heroines are dignified and maidenly in the most
 unconventional situations.—_Epoch_, N. Y.
 
 All Captain King’s stories are full of spirit and with the true ring
 about them.—_Philadelphia Item._
 
 Captain King’s stories of army life are so brilliant and intense, they
 have such a ring of true experience, and his characters are so lifelike
 and vivid that the announcement of a new one is always received with
 pleasure.—_New Haven Palladium._
 
 Captain King is a delightful story-teller.—_Washington Post._
 
 In the delineation of war scenes Captain King’s style is crisp and
 vigorous, inspiring in the breast of the reader a thrill of genuine
 patriotic fervor.—_Boston Commonwealth._
 
 Captain King is almost without a rival in the field he has chosen....
 His style is at once vigorous and sentimental in the best sense of that
 word, so that his novels are pleasing to young men as well as young
 women.—_Pittsburgh Bulletin._
 
 It is good to think that there is at least one man who believes that
 all the spirit of romance and chivalry has not yet died out of the
 world, and that there are as brave and honest hearts to-day as there
 were in the days of knights and paladins.—_Philadelphia Record._

 BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE CHRIST.
 
 
   By LEW. WALLACE. 16mo, Cloth, $1 50. _Garfield Edition._
     Two Volumes. Twenty Full-page Photogravures. Over 1000
     Illustrations as Marginal Drawings by WILLIAM MARTIN JOHNSON.
     Crown 8vo, Printed on Fine Super-calendered Plate-paper, Uncut
     Edges and Gilt Tops, Bound in Silk and Gold, $7 00. (_In a
     Gladstone Box._)
 
 Anything so startling, new, and distinctive as the leading feature of
 this romance does not often appear in works of fiction.... Some of Mr.
 Wallace’s writing is remarkable for its pathetic eloquence. The scenes
 described in the New Testament are rewritten with the power and skill
 of an accomplished master of style.—_N. Y. Times._
 
 Its real basis is a description of the life of the Jews and Romans
 at the beginning of the Christian era, and this is both forcible and
 brilliant.... We are carried through a surprising variety of scenes;
 we witness a sea-fight, a chariot-race, the internal economy of a
 Roman galley, domestic interiors at Antioch, at Jerusalem, and among
 the tribes of the desert; palaces, prisons, the haunts of dissipated
 Roman youth, the houses of pious families of Israel. There is plenty of
 exciting incident; everything is animated, vivid and glowing.—_N. Y.
 Tribune._
 
 From the opening of the volume to the very close the reader’s interest
 will be kept at the highest pitch, and the novel will be pronounced by
 all one of the greatest novels of the day.—_Boston Post._
 
 “Ben Hur” is interesting, and its characterization is fine and strong.
 Meanwhile it evinces careful study of the period in which the scene
 is laid, and will help those who read it with reasonable attention to
 realize the nature and conditions of Hebrew life in Jerusalem and Roman
 life at Antioch at the time of our Saviour’s advent.—_Examiner_, N. Y.
 
 The book is one of unquestionable power, and will be read with unwonted
 interest by many readers who are weary of the conventional novel and
 romance.—_Boston Journal._
 
 One of the most remarkable and delightful books. It is as real and
 warm as life itself, and as attractive as the grandest and most heroic
 chapters of history.—_Indianapolis Journal._

 1.F.
 
 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 ""Defects,"" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.
 
 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the ""Right
 of Replacement or Refund"" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
 
 
 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
 
 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.
 
 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation
 
 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.
 
 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

 “I am not here by accident,” he added after a lengthened silence; “nor
 have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday—only yesterday.
 Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?”
 
 “Stay,” said Rose. “You _do_ know all.”
 
 “All. You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the
 subject of our last discourse.”
 
 “I did.”
 
 “Not to press you to alter your determination,” pursued the young man,
 “but to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of
 station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still
 adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or
 act, to seek to change it.”
 
 “The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,”
 said Rose firmly. “If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose
 goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I
 ever feel it, as I should to-night? It is a struggle,” said Rose, “but
 one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.”
 
 “The disclosure of to-night,”—Harry began.
 
 “The disclosure of to-night,” replied Rose softly, “leaves me in the
 same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.”
 
 “You harden your heart against me, Rose,” urged her lover.
 
 “Oh Harry, Harry,” said the young lady, bursting into tears; “I wish I
 could, and spare myself this pain.”
 
 “Then why inflict it on yourself?” said Harry, taking her hand. “Think,
 dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.”
 
 “And what have I heard! What have I heard!” cried Rose. “That a sense
 of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned
 all—there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.”
 
 “Not yet, not yet,” said the young man, detaining her as she rose. “My
 hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my
 love for you: have undergone a change. I offer you, now, no distinction
 among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and
 detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but
 real disgrace and shame; but a home—a heart and home—yes, dearest Rose,
 and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.”
 
 “What do you mean!” she faltered.
 
 “I mean but this—that when I left you last, I left you with a firm
 determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me;
 resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine;
 that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn
 from it. This I have done. Those who have shrunk from me because of
 this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right. Such power and
 patronage: such relatives of influence and rank: as smiled upon me
 then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in
 England’s richest county; and by one village church—mine, Rose, my
 own!—there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of,
 than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold. This is
 my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!”
 
 
 “It’s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,” said Mr. Grimwig,
 waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head.
 
 Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time.
 Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together),
 could offer a word in extenuation.
 
 “I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,” said Mr. Grimwig,
 “for I began to think I should get nothing else. I’ll take the liberty,
 if you’ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.”
 
 Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the
 blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by
 the doctor and Mr. Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had
 been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the
 best authorities consider this downright scandal: he being young and a
 clergyman.
 
 “Oliver, my child,” said Mrs. Maylie, “where have you been, and why do
 you look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this
 moment. What is the matter?”
 
 It is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish,
 and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.
 
 Poor Dick was dead!
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER LII.
 FAGIN’S LAST NIGHT ALIVE
 
 
 The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive
 and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before
 the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the
 galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man—Fagin. Before him and
 behind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand
 surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.
 
 He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand
 resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and
 his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater
 distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was
 delivering his charge to the jury. At times, he turned his eyes sharply
 upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his
 favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible
 distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would,
 even then, urge something in his behalf. Beyond these manifestations of
 anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot. He had scarcely moved since the
 trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained
 in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on
 him, as though he listened still.
 
 A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking round,
 he saw that the jurymen had turned together, to consider their verdict.
 As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising
 above each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses
 to their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks
 expressive of abhorrence. A few there were, who seemed unmindful of
 him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could
 delay. But in no one face—not even among the women, of whom there were
 many there—could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any
 feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned.
 
 As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness
 came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards
 the judge. Hush!
 
 They only sought permission to retire.
 
 He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed
 out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was
 fruitless. The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed
 mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair. The man
 pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.
 
 He looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating,
 and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place
 was very hot. There was one young man sketching his face in a little
 note-book. He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the
 artist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any
 idle spectator might have done.
 
 In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind
 began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost,
 and how he put it on. There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too,
 who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back. He
 wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner,
 what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of
 careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused
 another.
 
 Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one
 oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it
 was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could
 not fix his thoughts upon it. Thus, even while he trembled, and turned
 burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron
 spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken
 off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was. Then, he
 thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold—and stopped
 to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it—and then went on to
 think again.
 
 At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all
 towards the door. The jury returned, and passed him close. He could
 glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone.
 Perfect stillness ensued—not a rustle—not a breath—Guilty.
 
 The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another,
 and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled
 out, like angry thunder. It was a peal of joy from the populace
 outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday.
 
 The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why
 sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his
 listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the
 demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it,
 and then he only muttered that he was an old man—an old man—and so,
 dropping into a whisper, was silent again.
 
 The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the
 same air and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation,
 called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry
 at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. The address
 was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he stood,
 like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve. His haggard face
 was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes
 staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and
 beckoned him away. He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and
 obeyed.
 
 They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners
 were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their
 friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.
 There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the
 prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were
 clinging to the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and
 screeched and hissed. He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them;
 but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by
 a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.
 
 Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of
 anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of
 the condemned cells, and left him there—alone.
 
 He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat
 and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to
 collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few
 disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed
 to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word. These gradually
 fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that
 in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered. To be
 hanged by the neck, till he was dead—that was the end. To be hanged by
 the neck till he was dead.
 
 As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known
 who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. They
 rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them. He
 had seen some of them die,—and had joked too, because they died with
 prayers upon their lips. With what a rattling noise the drop went down;
 and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling
 heaps of clothes!
 
 Some of them might have inhabited that very cell—sat upon that very
 spot. It was very dark; why didn’t they bring a light? The cell had
 been built for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last
 hours there. It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies—the
 cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath
 that hideous veil.—Light, light!
 
 At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door
 and walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into
 an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a
 mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left
 alone no more.
 
 Then came the night—dark, dismal, silent night. Other watchers are glad
 to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day.
 To him they brought despair. The boom of every iron bell came laden
 with the one, deep, hollow sound—Death. What availed the noise and
 bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was
 another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.
 
 The day passed off. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as
 come—and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in
 its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours. At one time he
 raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair.
 Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he
 had driven them away with curses. They renewed their charitable
 efforts, and he beat them off.
 
 Saturday night. He had only one night more to live. And as he thought
 of this, the day broke—Sunday.
 
 It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering
 sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon
 his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive
 hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than
 the dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of
 the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and
 they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention. He had
 sat there, awake, but dreaming. Now, he started up, every minute, and
 with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a
 paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they—used to such sights—recoiled
 from him with horror. He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures
 of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there,
 eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.
 
 He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had
 been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his
 capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair
 hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into
 knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh
 crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight—nine—then. If it was
 not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on
 each other’s heels, where would he be, when they came round again!
 Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had
 ceased to vibrate. At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own
 funeral train; at eleven—
 
 Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and
 such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and
 too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as
 that. The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man
 was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that
 night, if they could have seen him.
 
 From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two
 and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with
 anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received. These being
 answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to
 clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from
 which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built,
 and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the
 scene. By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the
 dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.
 
 The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,
 painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the
 pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared
 at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner,
 signed by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately admitted into the
 lodge.
 
 “Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?” said the man whose duty it
 was to conduct them. “It’s not a sight for children, sir.”
 
 “It is not indeed, my friend,” rejoined Mr. Brownlow; “but my business
 with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has
 seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as
 well—even at the cost of some pain and fear—that he should see him
 now.”
 
 These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.
 The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity,
 opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and
 led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.
 
 “This,” said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of
 workmen were making some preparations in profound silence—“this is the
 place he passes through. If you step this way, you can see the door he
 goes out at.”
 
 He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the
 prison food, and pointed to a door. There was an open grating above it,
 through which came the sound of men’s voices, mingled with the noise of
 hammering, and the throwing down of boards. They were putting up the
 scaffold.
 
 From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by
 other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard,
 ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row
 of strong doors on the left hand. Motioning them to remain where they
 were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The
 two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage,
 stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned
 the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell. They did so.
 
 The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side
 to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the
 face of a man. His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he
 continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence
 otherwise than as a part of his vision.
 
 “Good boy, Charley—well done—” he mumbled. “Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha!
 Oliver too—quite the gentleman now—quite the—take that boy away to
 bed!”
 
 The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not
 to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.
 
 “Take him away to bed!” cried Fagin. “Do you hear me, some of you? He
 has been the—the—somehow the cause of all this. It’s worth the money to
 bring him up to it—Bolter’s throat, Bill; never mind the girl—Bolter’s
 throat as deep as you can cut. Saw his head off!”
 
 “Fagin,” said the jailer.
 
 “That’s me!” cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of
 listening he had assumed upon his trial. “An old man, my Lord; a very
 old, old man!”
 
 “Here,” said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him
 down. “Here’s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I
 suppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?”
 
 “I shan’t be one long,” he replied, looking up with a face retaining no
 human expression but rage and terror. “Strike them all dead! What right
 have they to butcher me?”
 
 As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to
 the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted
 there.
 
 “Steady,” said the turnkey, still holding him down. “Now, sir, tell him
 what you want. Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time
 gets on.”
 
 “You have some papers,” said Mr. Brownlow advancing, “which were placed
 in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.”
 
 “It’s all a lie together,” replied Fagin. “I haven’t one—not one.”
 
 “For the love of God,” said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, “do not say that
 now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. You know
 that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of
 any further gain. Where are those papers?”
 
 “Oliver,” cried Fagin, beckoning to him. “Here, here! Let me whisper to
 you.”
 
 “I am not afraid,” said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr.
 Brownlow’s hand.
 
 “The papers,” said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, “are in a canvas
 bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I
 want to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.”
 
 “Yes, yes,” returned Oliver. “Let me say a prayer. Do! Let me say one
 prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till
 morning.”
 
 “Outside, outside,” replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards
 the door, and looking vacantly over his head. “Say I’ve gone to
 sleep—they’ll believe you. You can get me out, if you take me so. Now
 then, now then!”
 
 “Oh! God forgive this wretched man!” cried the boy with a burst of
 tears.
 
 “That’s right, that’s right,” said Fagin. “That’ll help us on. This
 door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don’t you
 mind, but hurry on. Now, now, now!”
 
 “Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?” inquired the turnkey.
 
 “No other question,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “If I hoped we could recall
 him to a sense of his position—”
 
 “Nothing will do that, sir,” replied the man, shaking his head. “You
 had better leave him.”
 
 The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.
 
 “Press on, press on,” cried Fagin. “Softly, but not so slow. Faster,
 faster!”
 
 The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp,
 held him back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an
 instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those
 massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.
 
 It was some time before they left the prison. Oliver nearly swooned
 after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more,
 he had not the strength to walk.
 
 Day was dawning when they again emerged. A great multitude had already
 assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing
 cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking.
 Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects
 in the centre of all—the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all
 the hideous apparatus of death.
 
 
 
 
  CHAPTER LIII.
 AND LAST
 
 
 The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.
 The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few
 and simple words.
 
 Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were
 married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of
 the young clergyman’s labours; on the same day they entered into
 possession of their new and happy home.
 
 Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to
 enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity
 that age and worth can know—the contemplation of the happiness of those
 on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent
 life, have been unceasingly bestowed.
 
 It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of
 property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered
 either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided
 between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than
 three thousand pounds. By the provisions of his father’s will, Oliver
 would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to
 deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices
 and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to
 which his young charge joyfully acceded.
 
 Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a
 distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he
 once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long
 confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk
 under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison. As far from
 home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin’s gang.
 
 Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old
 housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear
 friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver’s warm
 and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose
 condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever
 be known in this changing world.
 
 Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned
 to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would
 have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a
 feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. For
 two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared
 the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really
 no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his
 assistant, took a bachelor’s cottage outside the village of which his
 young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered. Here he took to
 gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits
 of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity.
 In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood,
 as a most profound authority.
 
 Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for
 Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He
 is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course
 of the year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and
 carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and
 unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite
 asseveration, that his mode is the right one. On Sundays, he never
 fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman’s face: always
 informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he
 considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say
 so. It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally
 him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the
 night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his
 return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in
 proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which
 always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.
 
 Mr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in
 consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering
 his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for
 some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened
 with too much work. After some consideration, he went into business as
 an informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence. His
 plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by
 Charlotte in respectable attire. The lady faints away at the doors of
 charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with
 three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next
 day, and pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints
 himself, but the result is the same.
 
 Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually
 reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in
 that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.
 Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation,
 he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his
 wife.
 
 As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts,
 although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. They
 sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among
 its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to
 this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which
 establishment they properly belong.
 
 Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes’s crime, fell into a train of
 reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.
 Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back
 upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of
 action. He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but,
 having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the
 end; and, from being a farmer’s drudge, and a carrier’s lad, he is now
 the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.
 
 And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches
 the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space,
 the thread of these adventures.
 
 I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long
 moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would
 show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood,
 shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell
 on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would paint
 her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer
 group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear
 the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would
 watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling
 untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and
 her dead sister’s child happy in their love for one another, and
 passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so
 sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little
 faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle;
 I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the
 sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye. These, and a
 thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech—I would fain
 recall them every one.
 
 How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his
 adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him,
 more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving
 seeds of all he wished him to become—how he traced in him new traits of
 his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances,
 melancholy and yet sweet and soothing—how the two orphans, tried by
 adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love,
 and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them—these
 are all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were
 truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and
 gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute
 is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be
 attained.
 
 Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble
 tablet, which bears as yet but one word: “AGNES.” There is no coffin in
 that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is
 placed above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to
 earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love—the love beyond the grave—of
 those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes
 sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less
 because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.

 Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
 
 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
 computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
 exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
 from people in all walks of life.
 
 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
 generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
 Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
 www.gutenberg.org
 
 Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation
 
 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
 state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
 Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
 number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
 U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

 Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
 to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
 and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
 
 Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation
 
 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
 widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.
 
 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
 DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
 state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
 
 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.
 
 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
 
 Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
 donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
 
 Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 
 Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
 freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
 distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
 volunteer support.
 
 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
",OliverTwist
59," death. There had been a rumour of suicide, and, in society, some talk of
 cause. Absurd enough, but, as Ella had reminded me, very prevalent and
 widespread. The rising young authoress was supposed to have been in love
 with an eminent politician. His wife died shortly before she started the
 long-delayed divorce proceedings against James Capel, and this gave
 colour to the rumour. It was hazarded that he had made it clear to her
 that remarriage was not in his mind. Few people knew of the real state
 of affairs. Gabriel Stanton shut that close mouth of his and told no
 one. I wondered about Gabriel Stanton, but more about Peter Kennedy, who
 had walked away from me when I spoke. What had happened to him in these
 eleven years? Into what manner of man had he grown? He came back
 presently, sat down again by my couch, spoke abruptly as if there had
 been no pause.
 
 “You want to know whether I have ever done for anybody what I did for
 Margaret Capel?”
 
 “Yes, that is what I asked you.”
 
 “Will you believe me when I tell you?”
 
 “Perhaps. Why did you first encourage me to write Margaret Capel’s life
 and then try and prevent my doing it?”
 
 “You won’t believe me when I tell you.”
 
 “Probably not.”
 
 “I wanted to know whether she had forgiven me, whether she was still
 glad. When you told me you saw and spoke to her....”
 
 “It was almost before that, if I remember rightly.”
 
 “It may have been. Do you remember I said you were a reincarnation? The
 first time I came in and saw you sitting there, at her writing-table, in
 her writing-chair, I thought of you as a reincarnation.”
 
 The light in his eyes was rather fitful, strange.
 
 “I was right, wasn’t I, Margaret?” He put a hand on my knee. I
 remembered how she had flung it off under similar circumstances. I let
 it lie there. Why not?
 
 “My name is Jane.” It came back to me that I had said this to him once
 before.
 
 “You don’t care for me at all?”
 
 “I am glad you thought of the intensive iodide treatment. It has its
 advantages over hyoscine.”
 
 “You have not changed?”
 
 “I would rather like you to remember this is the twentieth century.”
 
 He sighed and took his hand off my knee, drew it across his forehead.
 
 “You don’t know what the last few months have meant to me, coming up
 here again, every day or twice a day, taking care of you, giving you
 back those letters, knowing you knew....”
 
 “You had not the temptation to rid yourself of me again?”
 
 “You have grown so cold. I suppose you would not look at the idea of
 marrying me?”
 
 “You suppose quite correctly,” I answered, thinking of Ella, and what a
 score this would be to her.
 
 “It would make everything so right. I have been thinking of this ever
 since you began to get better, before, too. You will always be delicate,
 need a certain amount of care. No one could give it to you as well as I.
 Why not? I have almost the best practice in Pineland, and I deserve it,
 too. I’ve worked hard in these eleven years. I’ve given an honest
 scientific trial to every new treatment. I’ve saved scores of lives....”
 
 “Your own in jeopardy all the time.”
 
 “She asked me to do it, begged me to do it....” He spoke wildly.
 “Gabriel Stanton was inflexible, the marriage was to be postponed whilst
 Mrs. Roope was prosecuted, or the case fought out in the Law Courts. And
 every little anxiety or excitement set her poor heart beating ... put
 her in pain ... jeopardised her life. I’d do it again tomorrow. I don’t
 care who knows. You’ll have to tell if you want to. If you married me
 you couldn’t give evidence against me....”
 
 His smile startled me; it was strange, cunning. It seemed to say, “See
 how clever I am,—I have thought of everything.”
 
 “There, I have had that in my mind ever since you began to be better.”
 
 “It was not because you have fallen in love with me, then?” I scoffed.
 
 “When you are Margaret, I love you ... I adore you.” The whole secret
 flashed on me then, flashed through his strange perfervid eyes. We were
 in full view of a curious housemaid at a window, but he kneeled down by
 my couch, as he had kneeled by Margaret’s.
 
 “You are Margaret. Tell me the truth. There is no other fellow now. You
 always said if it were not for Gabriel Stanton....”
 
 I quieted him with difficulty. I saw what was the matter. Of course I
 ought to have seen it before, but vanity and Ella obscured the truth.
 The poor fellow’s mind was unhinged. For years he had brooded and
 brooded, yet worked magnificently at his profession, worked at making
 amends. The place and I had brought out the latent mischief. Now he
 implored me to marry him, to show him I was glad he had carried out my
 wishes.
 
 “Your heart is now quite well ... I have sounded it over and over again.
 You will never have a return of those pains. _Margaret...._”
 
 I got rid of him that day as quickly as possible, not answering yes or
 no definitely, marking time, soothing him disingenuously. Before the
 next day was at its meridian I had hurriedly left Carbies. Left
 Pineland, all the strange absorbing story, and this poor obsessed
 doctor. I left a letter for him, the most difficult piece of prose I
 have ever written. I was writing to a madman to persuade him he was
 sane! I gave urgent reasons for being in London, added a few lines, that
 I hoped he would understand, about having abandoned my intention of
 turning my morphia dreams into “copy”; tried to convey to him that he
 had nothing to fear from me....
 
 I never had an answer to my letter. I parried Ella’s raillery, resumed
 my old life. But I could not forget my country practitioner nor what I
 owed him. A peculiar tenderness lingered. However I might try to
 disguise names and places he would read through the lines. It was
 difficult to say what would be the effect on his mind and I would not
 take the risk. I held over my story as long as I was able, even wrote
 another meantime. But three months ago I became a free woman. I read in
 the obituary column of my morning paper that Peter Kennedy, M.D.,
 F.R.C.S., of Pineland, Isle of Wight, had died from the effects of a
 motor accident.
 
 The obituary notices were very handsome and raised him from the
 obscurity of a mere country practitioner. It mentioned the distinguished
 persons he had had under his care. The late Margaret Capel, for
 instance. But not myself! I suspected Dr. Lansdowne of having sent the
 notices to the press, _his_ name occurred in all of them, the
 partnership was bugled.
 
 Peter Kennedy died well. He was driving his car quickly on an urgent
 night call. Some strange cur frisked into the road and to avoid it he
 swerved suddenly. Death must have been instantaneous. I was glad that he
 died without pain. I had rather he was alive today, although my story
 had remained for ever unwritten. So few people have ever cared for me.
 Had I chosen I do believe his reincarnation theory would have held. And
 I should have had at least one lover to oppose to Ella’s many!

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
 
 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.
 
 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation
 
 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.
 
 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
 
 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.
 
 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
 
 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
